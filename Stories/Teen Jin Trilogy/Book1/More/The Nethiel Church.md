	The younger Sisters

The church of the Nethiel, the Nethiel Church, or simply the Nethiel are a modern religious community that somewhat spread all over Lygea after the [[Calamity|Calamity]]. It split off of and developed from the [[Die Silariel|Silariel Order]] and takes a lot of inspirations from the real [New Apostolic Faith](https://nak.org/en/faith).
# Faith
As is the case with other [[Die Nerivaner|nerivan]] denominations as well, the basis for the Nethiel faith are the scriptures of the **Pethana** (Words of Truth). It contains a collection of writings and religious documents believed to have originated from the **Silariel** faith, but which were refined (things were added, others removed) over the generations. 
The founder of the Nethiel denomination was the holy **Faé-Aestel** (Faithful Soul), who is also known as simply **The First Sprout**. She was a descendant from a line of [[Die Silariel#Darith - die Bewahrerinnen|Darith]], who developed the Nethiel doctrine while traveling the continent of [[Die Kontinente#Silviem|Silviem]].
## The Light
The Nethiel believe in the **Light** as the fundamental divine entity that created and still controls the entire universe. The **Light** is appearing and acting in 4 distinct forms, which are all considered to be one and the same, but also distinct from each other at the same time:
- The divine spirit [[Die Regimenta|Sil]], which shines truth and acceptance over the world
- The holy mother [[Neriva]], who sacrifices herself for the world's sins out of compassion
- The heavenly matron [[Eseyána]], who infuses the planet with life and love
- The saintly sister [[Seylúna]], who's imbuing the world with joy and hope
This four-part-one-being nature of the divine is also called the **Holy Cantha**.
## The Darkness
Opposing the holy **Light** are the forces of **Darkness**, of course, which try to destroy the world and lead all to sin. The Nethiel believe that everyone is born into **Darkness**, and can only be redeemed by the **Light**'s grace, their willingness to believe and to repent.
People living in **Darkness** are also said to be "burning" with sin. **Fire** is seen as another force opposing the **Light**, as a specific rather nasty manifestation of the **Darkness**. It is believed to be **Darkness** disguised as **Light**, which many think to be even more dangerous.
## The Sacrifice
The vilification of **Fire** has its origin in the story of **Neriva**'s sacrifice: **Eseyána**, whose roots reach all over the world, was overcome by the world's sin one day. She nearly burned to ashes by the fires of sin, but Neriva stepped in. Neriva took on the flames herself, loosing her physical form in the process, but saving **Eseyána** and vanquishing all the world's sin. The Nethiel believe only due to the sacrifice back then, sins can be forgiven today.
Though no virtue of the **Holy Cantha**, **Punctuality** is also seen as an aspect of **Light**. If asked why, believers will point to the story of **Neriva**'s sacrifice and state: **Neriva** chose the right time exactly to both safe **Eseyána** and nullify the world's sin at the same time.
## The Siláryl
The Siláryl is a small piece of amber given to each member as is similarly done by other denominations of the [[Die Silariel|Silarian]] religion. The **Siláryl** is quite literally seen as a piece of the **Light** that embeds itself in the wearer. It is supposed to protect the holder from the **Darkness** and to remind them of their devotion to the **Light** and their responsibility to turn away from sin.
For further details see the sacrament of [[#Caluva]] below. Each church also has a large amber embedded in its [[#Churches|nave]] wall.
## Emblem
All churches, books, or other related material is adorned with the **Nethiel-Emblem**. the church's identifying mark: An ember stone, held by flowery vines surrounded by light rays. While those are often painted, printed or otherwise depicted everywhere, each church has a main emblem close to the altar in the [[#Churches|Nave]]. Here, the ember is not a depiction but is the actuayl [[#The Siláryl|Syláryl]] of the given congregation.
# Ministries
The church is organized by a hierarchic structure of ministries. It is financed directly by what the believers give voluntarily as monetary offerings.
## Ranks
The church's ministries are divided into these broad ranks, which are mostly derived from the  [[Die Silariel|Silarian]] ministries:
- The **Idhár** - the wise ministries, or the Wise
	- interpret the [[#Faith|Pethana]]
	- ordain new ministers
	- lead the church
- The **Darsul** - the prophetic ministries, or the Prophets
	- support the **Idhár**
	- teach and support their entrusted **Darith**
- The **Darith** - the priestly ministries, or Priests
	- give pastoral care to members of a congregation
	- teach and support their entrusted **Thôsi**
- The **Thôsi** - the diaconal ministries
	- preach the word of **Light** in divine services
	- support their assigned **Darith** with their pastoral care
	- perform administrative and logistical duties in the congregation
All of these act in the name of the **Light**. They are authorized to perform certain rituals and give specific blessing depending on the given ministry. Ministries can generally be served by both sexes, but most of the Nethiel ministers are women.
## Additional Responsibilities
Each of the above ranks might still be divided into separate sub-ranks that come with additional responsibilities:
- **High Matron** (Ehrmutter) - This is the actual leader of the Nethiel. She's the living and breathing representation of the **Light** on the planet.
- **District**- (Bezirks-) - This prefix marks one of the **Idhár**(Wise) or the **Darsul**(Prophet) as the leader and administrator of a district area.
- **Matron** (Oberin) - This title is given to the leader of one congregation. 
## Ordination
Women or men chosen for serving a ministry are selected by the **Light** itself, which will make its will known by making the chosen one's [[#The Siláryl|Siláryl]] start to slowly pulse with a warm light. Only the **Wise**(Idhár) are authorized by the **Light** to bless the candidates and actually ordain them then. They do so via the [[#Rituals & Sacraments|ordination ceremony]]. The chosen ones are free to follow the calling, though. And it is not uncommon that a call remains unanswered, since serving a ministry is an important life choice, and comes with many responsibilities.
## Sermons
Sermons are believed to be inspired by the **Light**, in the moment. That means none of the ministries know what they will talk about before they step on the altar. The thematic frame of each divine service is known in advance, however, and the church provides some material so ministers can prepare themselves a bit.
# Organization
The church is divided into regional districts, depending on the density of believers. There are congregations all over Lygea but the densest areas for this faith are the continent of [[Die Kontinente#Silviem|Silviem]] and free nation of [[Bardeena]]. The size of a district usually correlates with other geographic factors and often stays on the city level, e.g. the district of [[Haarafir]]. 
## Churches
Members do belong to specific congregations based on where they live. A congregation is housed by a Nethiel church building. These are rather plain but bright modern buildings where masses are held and the believers come together for other kinds of activities.
The different churches vary in design and architectural elements, but all of them will contain the following rooms:
- **Entrance Hall**: This is the first room right at the entrance. Serving ministers, usually at least one of the [[#Ranks|Thôsi]], will greet arriving members and guests via handshake. The coat racks can also be found here.
- **Kitchen & Sanitary Facilities**: For post mass coffee, cake and people need a restroom, too, of course.
- **Children's Room**: A smaller, separated sitting room, with a large window allowing a view to the altar. Children are a blessing, but they are also loud and easily disturb the sanctity of mass.
- **Nave**: The church's main room of worship, where masses are held, concerts take place and generally the main activities are going on. Usually a flower decorated altar, an organ, and seating arrangements are there, too, of course.
- The **Thamar** (Holy Room): The church's inner sanctum. Here the ministries gather to prepare themselves for mass, discuss issues of faith or pray together.
## Mass
Divine services, called masses, are held twice a week on Shaedays in the evening and on Lihday mornings. They are all held according to the following liturgy:
- **Gathering**: Believers and ministers assemble. Ministers go into the [[#Churches|Thamar]] to prepare for the mass, while believers quietly sit down in the **Nave** to say their quite personal prayers, calm down, and individually prepare themselves for mass. While they wait, the organ plays interrupted by chorales from the choir. Shortly before the beginning, everything will go quite.
- **Hymn**: After a prayer amongst the ministers, the organ will start playing, everyone gets up to sing as the ministers take their seats on and around the altar.
- **Verse**: After the Hymn, the mass leader - usually the church's [[#Additional Responsibilities|Matron]] - reads a verse from the [[#Faith|Pethana]] as the thematic frame for this mass. Then everyone sits down again, except the leader, and the choir sings.
- **Sermon**: The main sermon is held by the mass leader. After they're done, they may choose a number, usually one or two, followup-preachers from the pool of ministers at their disposal. Often those are preceded by the choir or an orchestra number.
- **Sandaira**: The ritual of [[#Sandaira]] is performed.
- **Ani-Gala**: The ritual of [[#Ani-Gala]] marks the end of the mass, after which the congregation disperses at everyone's own pace.
## Music
Music plays a very important role for the Nethiel. It is used to create a divine atmosphere and helps the believers get into the right mind and mood for what the **Light** has to say. As a tool of worship, many churches at least a small choir made up of voluntary believers. Bigger congregations even have their own voluntary orchestras, and Nethiel concerts are also regularly organized.
There are also multiple Nethiel-branded hymnals created for different purposes, e.g. general divine service, choir, funerals, advanced for bigger events, etc. The chorales in those books have different sources, but will all praise, honor, and worship the **Light**, and are therefore of a similar nature. Other types of music are generally frowned upon in the "holy context" like a mass.
# Rituals & Sacraments
These rituals and sacraments are part of the Nethiel faith, and are usually practiced as part of a mass.
## Sandaira
	Protection for the divine
The Nethiel believe that over time their given light - symbolized by the [[#The Siláryl|Siláryl]] - is weakening over time, and they will taint themselves with sin whenever they're not behaving according to doctrine. To charge the divine power of their pieces of **Light**, and to cleanse themselves from the embers of sin, the sacrament of **Sandaira** is practiced in every divine service. Skipping this just once, is believed to be very dangerous, since the **Darkness** will have an easier time to corrupt one's soul then.
## Ani-Gala
	Proof of brightness
Each divine service ends with this ritual. The believers present their [[#The Siláryl|Siláryl]] with one hand in a unified gesture, while singing "**Gala**" three times with a loud voice. Every single amber, including the one embedded in the [[#Churches|Nave]] wall, will glow warmly during this ritual.
Very devout souls will raise their other hand and [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Animation|animate]] a ball of light in it. Those able to to that are believed to be close and specially blessed by the **Light**. The Nethiel also believe that everyone who [[#Caluva|received the Light]] is able to do that with faith and devotion. They are generally unaware of and therefore ignore the [[Mystisches Potential#Level B - Volks Level|known limitations]].
## Navá-Dua 
	taken from the night
The Nethiel believe that everyone is initially born in and belonging to the **Darkness**. In order to bring a soul closer to the **Light**, it has to be brought out of the **Darkness** first. So, the first official act anyone joining the Nethiel - by birth or by choice - will undergo, is the sacrament of **Navá-Dua**.
One of the [[#Ranks|Darith]] or higher can initiate the new member this way.
The initiate will step in front of the congregation - in case the of newborns the parents will present their child. The **Wise** will then prepare and explain to the soul what blessing is about to come unto them, and what this means. Then they will touch their [[#The Siláryl|Siláryl]] to the initiate's forehead, while speaking a prayer. The prayer concludes with the **Wise** asking the **Light** to raise the presented soul from **Darkness**, which is answered by a bright glow from the amber.
## Caluva
	Piece of light inside
With the [[#Navá-Dua]] the soul is rescued from the **Darkness**. But to truly become a *Child of Light*, and to prevent a fall back into the **Darkness**, the sacrament of **Caluva** is performed shortly after. Here the **Light** establishes a connection to and becomes part of the soul forever. The one receiving the gift of **Light** is believed to be fully reborn from **Darkness**.
The sacrament is performed by one of the [[#Ranks|Idhár]]. While praying they take a small piece of the church's [[#The Siláryl|Siláryl]], and [[Die Mystik|mysticly]] embeds it into the back of the member's left hand. Bright glowing accompanies the ritual, which is completely painless. On the contrary, the embedding is a very pleasant experience.
## Naloth
	The Calling
Those chosen to serve a ministry will be ordained by an [[#Ranks|Idhár]] as well. The ritual of **Naloth** is the ceremony by wich that happens. The minister-to-be will have another piece of a church's [[#The Siláryl|Siláryl]] embedded into their right hand.
With the two ambers, they are blessed, empowered to serve, encouraged to give their life to the **Light**, to preach the Nethiel faith in its name, and to care for the souls under its glow.
## More
Other rituals of note are:
- **Immaciel** (Choice of self) - when a child comes of age, the responsibility of keeping the ways of the **Light**, are transferred from the parents to the adolescent. 
- **Melartha** (Union of Love) - the ritual of marriage, which is a modernized version of the classic [[Die Nerivaner#Die Hochzeit - Die Gründung einer Familie|Nerivan wedding]].
# More
- As a [[Die Silariel|Silarian]] religion, the Nethiel also see the female sex as the stronger, more capable one. That is also why women, and especially Mothers, are generally treated with more respect and honor.
- Similarly, [[Die Pflanzen|Plants]] are also seen as divine beings. Some say they are the children of **Eseyána**, others treat them as her legions (e.g. like angels). Individuals even restrain religiously from hurting any of them (anti-vegetarians).
- Doubting any of the Nethiel believes is generally frowned upon, and is said to be a way to open one's soul to the **Darkness** (embers of doubt). The most hardcore believers even treat it as equal to sinning.
- It is also believed that the **Light** gave everyone a free will, in order to freely decide for the ways of the **Light** or **Darkness**. Which is also a point of controversy amongst critics.
- Masses are held in many forms: Sometimes multiple congregations meet in one church, ministers visit neighboring congregations, masses are held for the youth, seniors, ministers on the district level, etc...
- The Nethiel have their own holy days and festivities spread across the [[Der lygeanische Kalender|lygean calendar]].
- Contrary to the theme of light, Nethiel ministers have a rather dark Dresscode. All of them dress in fully black business suits, black ties and white shirts (to symbolize the Light shining out of the Darkness)

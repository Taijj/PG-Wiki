The church of the Nethiel, the Nethiel Church, or simply the Nethiel are a modern religious community that somewhat spread all over Lygea after the [[Calamity|Calamity]]. It split off of and developed from the [[Die Silariel|Silariel Order]] and takes a lot of inspirations from the real [New Apostolic Faith](https://nak.org/en/faith).
# Faith
As is the case with other [[Die Nerivaner|nerivan]] denominations as well, the basis for the Nethiel faith are the scriptures of the **Pethana** (Words of Truth). It contains a collection of writings and religious documents believed to have originated from the **Silariel** faith, but which were refined (things were added, others removed) over the generations. 
The founder of the Nethiel denomination was the holy **Faé-Aestel** (Faithful Soul), who is also known as simply **The First Sprout**. She was a descendant from a line of [[Die Silariel#Darith - die Bewahrerinnen|Darith]], who developed the Nethiel doctrine while traveling the continent of [[Die Kontinente#Silviem|Silviem]].
## The Light
The Nethiel believe in the **Light** as the fundamental divine entity that created and still controls the entire universe. The **Light** is appearing and acting in 4 distinct forms, which are all considered to be one and the same, but also distinct from each other at the same time:
- The divine spirit [[Die Regimenta|Sil]], which shines truth and acceptance over the world
- The holy mother [[Neriva]], who sacrifices herself for the world's sins out of compassion
- The heavenly matron [[Eseyána]], who infuses the planet with life and love
- The saintly sister [[Seylúna]], who's imbuing the world with joy and hope
This four-part-one-being nature of the divine is also called the **Holy Cantha**.
## The Darkness
Opposing the holy **Light** are the forces of **Darkness**, of course, which try to destroy the world and lead all to sin. The Nethiel believe that everyone is born into **Darkness**, and can only be redeemed by the **Light**'s grace, their willingness to believe and to repent.
People living in **Darkness** are also said to be "burning" with sin. **Fire** is seen as another force opposing the **Light**, as a specific rather nasty manifestation of the **Darkness**. It is believed to be **Darkness** disguised as **Light**, which many think to be even more dangerous.
## The Sacrifice
The vilification of **Fire** has its origin in the story of **Neriva**'s sacrifice: **Eseyána**, whose roots reach all over the world, was overcome by the world's sin one day. She nearly burned to ashes by the fires of sin, but Neriva stepped in. Neriva took on the flames herself, loosing her physical form in the process, but saving **Eseyána** and vanquishing all the world's sin. The Nethiel believe only due to the sacrifice back then, sins can be forgiven today.
Though no virtue of the **Holy Cantha**, **Punctuality** is also seen as an aspect of **Light**. If asked why, believers will point to the story of **Neriva**'s sacrifice and state: **Neriva** chose the right time exactly to both safe **Eseyána** and nullify the world's sin at the same time.
## More
- As a **Silarian** religion, the Nethiel also see the female sex as the stronger, more capable one. That is also why women, and especially Mothers, are generally treated with more respect and honor.
- Similarly, [[Die Pflanzen|Plants]] are also seen as divine beings. Some say they are the children of **Eseyána**, others treat them as her legions (e.g. like angels). Individuals even restrain religiously from hurting any of them (anti-vegetarians).
- Doubting any of the Nethiel believes is generally frowned upon, and is said to be a way to open one's soul to the **Darkness** (embers of doubt). The most hardcore believers even treat it as equal to sinning.
- It is also believed that the **Light** gave everyone a free will, in order to freely decide for the ways of the **Light** or **Darkness**. Which is also a point of controversy amongst critics.
# Organization
The church is organized by a hierarchic structure of ministries. It is financed directly by what the believers give voluntarily as monetary offerings.

- The **Mariel** - motherly ministries. These are the highest ranks the church  Stamm-, Bezirks-, Apostel

	taken from the night
The Nethiel believe that everyone is initially born in and belonging to the **Darkness**. In order to bring a soul closer to the **Light**, it has to be brought out of the **Darkness** first. So, the first official act anyone joining the Nethiel - by birth or by choice - will undergo, is the ritual of **Navá-Dua**.

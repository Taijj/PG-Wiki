# Physical
As a [[Mischlinge|hybrid]] she features elements of both her sides, [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] and [[Die Teyaner|Teyan]]. Her body is rather thin and long with subtle female curves. She looks like she's in her (human) mid-30s.
Long **Nerivan** horns grow through her straight blonde hair, which reaches to the middle of her shoulder blades. Her ears tend more to the **Teyan** side. She's got 4 rather equally sized **Nerivan** arms, **Nerivan** feet, and **Teyan** muscles but no **Teyan** armoring.
Her posture suggests a strict character but the bright smile in her warm face proofs otherwise.
## Apparel & Accessoires
Lucida wears a shining white buttoned up blouse and a long pastel colored skirt. Dark, elegantly laced ballerinas cover her hooves. Her appearance is simple but elegant. As a therapist a pen and a clipboard are always nearby, as well as a cup of tea.
## Hygiene
She apparently takes good care of herself, since she generally looks clean, neat, and healthy. The only makeup she's wearing is a bright red lipstick and her perfume leaves a pleasant smell of summer behind wherever she goes.
# Personality
Lucida keeps a businesslike distance to her patients, but also tries to keep the mood in [[#Her Office]] bright, warm, and friendly. She tries not too come off too motherly and acts more like a mature friend, e.g. a concerned aunt. She stays focused on her patients without revealing too much about herself.
# Personal
Pretty much nothing is known about her personal life, and she's quick to avoid any questions relating to it, at least to the most important stuff.
## Habits
She likes to sit cross legged with open arms on the chair in her [[#Her Office|office]]. She often switches the legs around and wiggles the foot in the air while thinking. Her pen is covered in bite marks, since she also likes to chew on it while formulating her diagnoses.
## Speech & Gestures
Dignified is the adjective best describing her speech and gesture patterns. She sometimes uses great words and often likes to nest her sentences while verbalizing her train of thoughts. She does not abbreviate and keeps a perfect standard speech.
# Social
As with other personal stuff, she keeps quite about these - she is the therapist, after all, and not the patient. She also seems to keep a similar level of distance to her colleagues, since she didn't make any friends among them, yet. It is well known, though, that she came to town rather recently and didn't have a lot of opportunity. She also doesn't go out much after hours, and is always quick to - politely and friendly - decline any offers.
# Professional
 Lucida went to university in [[Bavista]] to study Psychology. She concluded her studies with an internship at [[The Institute of Science#Section XI|Section XI]] before she moved to [[Haarafir]], where she started work at **Enjar MID**, one of the city's [[The Institute of Science#MID(dle) School|Middle Schools]]. So she's not very experienced in her field by the count of years, but the school had an opening and she passed the tests with flying colors.
## Her Office
Its not actually her office. She pretty much got the office from her predecessor and besides the name on the door, almost nothing changed since she moved in. She was still new and took over the predecessor's cases as well, which was a huge change for the patients already. So, she decided to leave the office as is for now.
The office is a small elongated room, with softly green painted walls. Matching green curtains hang on a big window which lets the evening sunlight in. On the left wall is a green couch for sitting or lying, and an equally colored sitting chair on the other side can be reached over a soft and colorful carpet. A small desk with a lamp, a water cooker, and a tea box stands by the window. A small table can be found next to the sitting chair. Potted plants are distributed all over the office and walls, together with pictures of various ink blots.
# Forecast & Spoilers
- Lucida is only a pseudonym. In reality she's [[Agent WHITE BISHOP]] sent by [[CHESS]] to infiltrate [[Bardeena]] and find a way to capture [[The Capsule Kids]] for the organization.
- Of course, she arranged the open position at **Enjar MID** so she could get close to [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin and his siblings]].
- She plans to look for a way to get rid of [[Aunt Nia]], weaken [[Bardeena]]'s defenses, and gain the children's trust.

# Physical
Debrann is a middle aged [[Mischlinge|hybrid]] man. His features are a good mixture between the two races, [[Die Forasier|Teyan]] and [[Die Forasier|Forasian]]: His hair, face, tail, feet, skin pattern (spotted), and general body shape are rather **Forasian**. From his **Teyan** side he's got the 4 arms and some armoring. His arms and legs generally look **Forasian**, too, but **Teyan** armoring can be found on his shoulders, main arms, and shins. His auxiliary arms are **Teyan**-typically smaller, too.
He is still a rather small men, compared to both races. The center of his torso is well rounded, but his extremities show signs of well toned muscles, too. His head and face are rather rounded, and he likes to keep his hair short, since its currently in the process of receding heavily. His chin is usually shaved clean.
## Apparel & Accessoires
During his spare time, he's usually wearing simple jeans and buttoned shirts, with checked patterns, that are tucked inside his pants. He often wears a blue jumpsuit as well, since he also likes to work, construct, and tinker a lot in his workshop. And he's wearing it for work, too, of course. At [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] he's wearing a [[The Nethiel Church#More|minister's black suit]] to fulfill his duties.
## Hygiene
It is not unusual to find him covered in sawdust, stained with oil, or other smeary substances, since he likes to work a lot. After work, he properly cleans up, though. He shaves every day, and before [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], he's actually the one taking the longest to get ready (why is anyone's guess).
## Enhanced Senses
He inherited a [[Die Teyaner|Teyan]] sense of touch to some degree. However, he is pretty unaware of the fact that it's a **Teyan** ability and expects similar sensibilities in his [[#Children]].
# Personality
Debrann is a very devout [[#Spiritual Beliefs|Nethiel]] to the degree that this faith pretty much dictates his entire personality. He rates everything and everyone according to the doctrine, and actively tries to inject the teachings into any conversation at any moment he seems fitting.
He is rigid in his opinions and beliefs, but is still rather kind and tolerant towards others. If he encounters opposition, he will avoid arguments and quietly agrees to disagree.
## Flaws
His avoidance of arguments and quite nature lets him come of as a pushover or wuss at times. His rigidity make him immune to any kind of alternative perspective on things, especially concerning matters of faith. He is often unreasonably thorough, which lets him complete tasks at a very slow pace.
While he's not picking a fight with anyone, he is very strict with his own [[#Children]] and believes in the educational effects of physical punishment. They are also the ones suffering the most, if he gets angry. Since he keeps it inside with anyone else, including his [[#Wife]], the children have to take it, if it appears.
He's a pretty bad teacher and his sense of humor is cringy at best.
## Strengths
Generally he is a very kind, soft, and tender person, who's not attracting any attention. He's a diligent and thorough worker, and results of his work are usually of the highest quality. His strong faith sometimes does inspire the one or other soul, too.
He's got a small passion for food and cooking and his dishes, though not first class, still taste very good more often than not.
## Spiritual Beliefs
Debrann is a very strong believer in the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] doctrine to a degree that his whole [[#Personality]] is affected by it. For him, its the right way of life and the definite reality of how the universe works. He also strongly believes that the [[The Nethiel Church#The Light|Light]], in whatever form, actively directs his life, sometimes even by giving him actual visions.
With this level of devotion he was taken on as a [[The Nethiel Church#Ministries|deacon]] in his congregation. This way he can live and act out his faith as well.

# Personal
Most of his time is spent with providing for the [[#Family]] by doing his [[#Professional|job]]. In his spare time he likes to enjoy a bit of screentime, either by watching TV with [[#Wife|Mayra]] or by playing an RTS videogame on the computer. He also often works in his [[#His Workshop|workshop]] and the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|ministry]] keeps him busy, too.
## His Workshop
A small part of the family funds are used for the rent of a nearby garage. But this garage is not for a car. Instead it contains an extensive workshop for repairs of any kind, for assembling furniture, doing electrical wiring, mechanical constructions, or whatever else is waiting on the agenda. The garage and the workshop have become one and the same and the terms are often used interchangeably.
Debrann used to have a garage space like this in the old [[#Family Residence|family house]], and insisted on getting a similar one after they moved. Garage spaces are not that easy to come by in the city, though. He tried a few offers and currently had to settle for one that is a short distance away from home.
He keeps his workshop organized and makes sure to tidy up properly after each finished project. However, there are are number of drawers and shelfs that just contain a chaotic mess of spare parts like cables, circuit boards, individual speakers, or other types of electrical replacement units.
He likes to tinker and craft different things here, and this is also his favorite spot to spend time with his [[#Children]]. He thinks this way they can spend quality time and he can teach them valuably construction skills. Sadly, they all unanimously hate going to the workshop with him...
## Habits
- Before each meal, he likes to open the [[The Nethiel Church#Faith|Pethana]] and read a verse for inspiration, in addition to speaking a table prayer
- He often spends his [[Der lygeanische Kalender|Fidays]] at his [[#His Workshop|workshop]], either alone or with one of his [[#Children]].
## Speech & Gestures
Debrann has a rather quite and soft voice, which can easily sound strained. That is due to a condition that makes his voice quickly loose strength. He used to sing in the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] choir until the doctor recommended to stop. That doesn't prevent him from randomly starting to sing a choral, though, unbearably off key, of course.
Still, his speech is rather standard, and he tends to talk sparsely. 
# Social
As a member and minister in [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], he is well connected. However, he does not have many close friends. The closest people he has in his life are his [[#Wife]] and his [[#Samuel Karat|boss]].
## Family
He is rather glad to have the responsibilities of providing for the family instead of directly raising the [[#Children]] himself, as is [[Die Forasier|Forasian]] tradition. He is, however, very interested in the way his children are raised. He values responsibility, respect, and faith the most and tries to teach accordingly.
In the past that often clashed with the free spirited nature of his belated [[Raphaela Naidesh|Raphaela]] and others coming before her.
### Members
At the moment, the **Naidesh**-Family consist of 7 members.
#### Wife
Currently, Debrann is married to [[Mayra Naidesh]], which is his 3rd wife in total. To him, she is like a 5th form of the [[The Nethiel Church#The Light|Light]], and he loves and worships her accordingly. He is also very happy with the way she handles the [[#Children]], supports her every decisions, and gladly leaves her to it.
After [[Raphaela Naidesh|Raphaela]] died, he claims to have seen **Mayra** in a vision by the **Light**. So he already knew, he would marry her, before they even met.
In reality, the divorce of his fist wife - with another child left behind - and the death of his second one left him severely traumatized. He's literally hiding inside his faith and doesn't like to talk or explore those traumas further.
#### Children
Debrann is the only family member left alive who has some kind of a clue who his children really are. He doesn't know the full truth, though, and after he agreed to take them in, he now loves them as his own.
While **Raphaela** had given them actual [[Die Titanier|Titanian]] names, inspired by [[The Capsule Kids|how they were found]], Debrann resolved on also giving them "proper normal" names as well. That is why they all have second names.
Debrann tries to deal with and treat all his children equally. He has a certain opinion on how children should think and behave and equally teaches his values for all of them. He leaves the ironing out of individual personalities to **Mayra**.
- [[Kyashi Naidesh I|Kyashi]] the eldest girl, who's already an adult
- [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]], the next younger
- [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin]] the older son
- [[Forashi Naidesh I|Forashi]] the younger son
- [[Tashi Naidesh I|Tashi]] the youngest daughter
### Mao
The Naideshs used to have another son, who got lost at the accident [[Raphaela Naidesh|Raphaela]] died. Officially he got kidnapped by wild beasts before the rescuers arrived. Another trauma to add to Debrann's delusions. [[#Nia]]'s suggestion to remove Mao off of Debrann's memories, as she did with the [[#Children]], was accepted with relieve.
### Family Residence
After loosing his second [[#Wife]], Debrann was not very eager to stay in the house the family had occupied. Sure, it was more spacy and situated in a nicer location, but it also reminded him of [[Raphaela Naidesh|Raphaela]] wherever he went. So, when the opportunity arrived, and [[Mayra Naidesh|Mayra]] voiced her preference to stay in her appartement, he immediately agreed to take the kids and move in with her.
Since the house originally belonged to **Raphaela**, he is not a greedy person at all, and he didn't want to have anything to do with it anymore anyway, he actually gifted the house to [[#Acquaintances|Nia]]. For him it was not really a gift, he was glad to get rid of it.
## Acquaintances
Outside of his family, these two also play an important role in his life.
### Samuel Karat
Samuel is his employer. He's a fair and rather kind business man with some experience and knowledge in the fields Debrann works in. Debrann is a reliable and loyal employee and so Samuel is very fond of him. Samuel often gives him special treatment and Debrann often steps in and helps out even past hours.
# Nia
[[Aunt Nia|Nia]] had been a loyal friend of the family for years now, but Debrann actually almost knows nothing about her. He only remembers her suddenly appearing in their lives a year after [[#Wife|Raphaela]] brought home [[Forashi Naidesh I|Forashi]]. She used to be a close friend of **Raphaela**'s and he actually doesn't know her that well.
All he knows is that she knows the truth about his [[#Children]], and that she's very fond of them. He's fine with not knowing more, since she also stepped up and helped out a lot after **Raphaela**'s death. He could rely on her during these hard times. And she earned his respect and thanks in the process.
Nowadays, he's okay with her training the kids. He might not share her motives, but it cannot hurt, if they learn some discipline and blow of steam in the process.
# Professional
Debrann works as a mechanical engineer in a small independent company named *Karat Filling Systems* (Abfüllanlagen Karat). [[#Samuel Karat]] owns this little company and leads a team of 15 employees.
He's designing and developing machines and systems for metering and filling substances for further processing. In his job he's using mechanical, mathematical, and electric principles to build machines for different clients.

# Physical
Debrann is a middle aged [[Mischlinge|hybrid]] man. His features are a good mixture between the two races, [[Die Forasier|Teyan]] and [[Die Forasier|Forasian]]: His hair, face, tail, feet, skin pattern (spotted) and general body shape are rather **Forasian**. From his **Teyan** side he's got the 4 arms and some armoring. His arms and legs generally look **Forasian**, too, but **Teyan** armoring can be found on his shoulders, main arms, and shins. His auxiliary arms are **Teyan**-typcially smaller, too.
He is still a rather small men, compared to both races. The center of his torso is well rounded, but his extremities show signs well toned muscles, too. His head and face are rather rounded, and he likes to keep his hair short, since its currently in the process of receding heavily. His chin is usually shaved clean.
## Apparel & Accessoires
During his spare time, he's usually wearing simple jeans and buttoned shirts, with checked patterns, that are tucked inside his pants. He often wears a blue jumpsuit as well, since he also likes to work, construct, and tinker a lot in his workshop, and he's wearing it for work, too, of course. At [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] he's wearing a [[The Nethiel Church#More|minister's black suit]], of course.
## Hygiene
It is not unusual to find him covered in sawdust, stained with oil, or other smeary substances, since he likes to work a lot. After work, he properly cleans up, though. He shaves every day, and before [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], he's actually the one taking the longest to get ready (why is anyone's guess).
## Enhanced Senses
He inherited a [[Die Teyaner|Teyan]] sense of touch to some degree. However, he is pretty unaware of the fact that it's a **Teyan** ability and expects similar sensibility in his children.
# Personality
Debrann is a very devout [[#Spiritual Beliefs|Nethiel]] to a degree that this faith pretty much dictates his entire personality. He rates everything and everyone according to the doctrine, and actively tries to inject the teachings into any conversation at any moment he seems fitting.
He is rigid in his opinions and beliefs, but is still rather kind and tolerant towards others. If he encounters opposition, he will avoid arguments and quietly agrees to disagree.
## Flaws
His avoidance of arguments and quite nature lets him come of as a pushover or wuss at times. His rigidity make him immune to any kind of alternative perspective on things, especially concerning matters of faith. He is often unreasonably thorough, which lets him complete tasks at a very slow pace.
While he's not picking a fight with anyone, he is very strict with his own children and believes in the educating effects of physical punishments. They are also the ones suffering the most, if he gets angry. Since he keeps it inside with anyone else, including his [[#Wife]], the children have to take it, if it appears.
He's a pretty bad teacher and his sense of humor is shared by pretty much nobody else...
## Strengths
Generally he is a very kind, soft, and tender person, who's not attracting any attention. He's a diligent and thorough worker, and results of his work are usually of the highest quality. His strong faith sometimes does inspire the one or other soul, too.
He's got a small passion for food and cooking and his dishes, though not first class, still taste very good more often than not.
## Spiritual Beliefs
Debrann is a very strong believer in the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] doctrine to a degree that his whole [[#Personality]] is affected by it. For him, its the right way of life and the definite reality of how the universe works. He also strongly believes that the [[The Nethiel Church#The Light|Light]], in whatever form, actively directs his life, sometimes even by giving him actual visions.
With this level of devotion he was taken on as a [[The Nethiel Church#Ministries|deacon]] in his congregation, and can live his faith this way, as well.

# Personal
The most time Debrann spends with providing for the [[#Family]] by doing his [[#Professional|job]]. In his spare time he likes to enjoy a bit of screentime, either by watching TV with [[#Wife|Mayra]] or by playing an RTS videogame on the computer. He also often works in his [[#His Workshop|workshop]] and [[#Spiritual Beliefs|ministry]] keeps him busy, too.
## His Workshop
A small part of the family funds are used to pay the rent for a nearby garage. But this garage is not housing a car. Instead it contains an extensive workshop for repairs of any kind, for assembling furniture, doing electrical wiring, mechanical constructions, or whatever else is waiting on the agenda. The garage and the workshop have become one and the same and the terms are often used interchangeably.
Debrann used to have a garage space like this in the old [[#Family Residence|family house]], and insisted on getting similar one after they moved, too. Garage spaces are not that easy to come by in the city, though. He tried a few offers and currently had to settle for one that is a short distance away from home.
He keeps his workshop organized and makes sure to tidy up properly after each finished project. However, there are are number of drawers and shelfs that just contain a chaotic mess of spare parts like cables, circuit boards, individual speakers, or other types of electrical replacement unit.
He likes to tinker and craft different things here, and this is also his favorite spot to spend time with his [[#Children]]. He thinks this way they can bond well and he can teach them valuably construction skills. Sadly, they all unanimously hate going to the workshop with him...
## Habits
- Before each meal, he likes to open the [[The Nethiel Church#Faith|Pethana]] and read a verse for inspiration, in addition to speaking a table prayer
- He often spends his [[Der lygeanische Kalender|Fidays]] at his [[#His Workshop|workshop]], either alone or with any of his [[#Children]].
## Speech & Gestures
Debrann has a rather quite and soft voice, which can easily sound strained. That is due to a condition he has that makes his voice quickly loose strength. He used to sing in the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] choir until the doctor recommended to stop. That doesn't prevent him from randomly starting to sing a choral, though, unbearably off key, of course.
Still, his speech is rather standard, and he tends to talk sparsely. 
# Social
As a member and minister in [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], he is well connected. However, he does not have any close friends. The closest people he has in his life are his [[#Wife]] and his [[#Professional]] boss.
## Family
He is rather glad to have the responsibilities of providing for the family instead of directly raising the [[#Children]] himself, as is [[Die Forasier|Forasian]] tradition. He is, however, very interested in the way his children are raised. He values responsibility, respect, and faith the most and tries to teach accordingly.
In the past that often clashed with the free spirited nature of his belated wife [[Raphaela Naidesh|Raphaela]] and others coming before her.
### Members
At the moment, the **Naidesh**-Family consist of 7 members.
#### Wife
Currently, Debrann is married to [[Mayra Naidesh]], which is is 3rd wife total. To him, she is like a 5th form of the [[The Nethiel Church#The Light|Light]], and he loves and worships her accordingly. He is also very happy with the way she handles the [[#Children]], supports her every decisions, and gladly leaves her to it.
After [[Raphaela Naidesh|Raphaela]] died, he claims to have seen **Mayra** in a vision by the **Light**. So he already knew, he would marry her, before they even met.
In reality, the divorce of his fist wife - with another child left behind - and the death of his second one left him severely traumatized. He's literally hiding inside his faith and doesn't like to talk or explore those traumas further.
#### Children
Debrann is the only family member left alive who has some kind of a clue who his children really are. He doesn't know the full truth, though, and after he agreed to take them in, he now loves them as his own.
While **Raphaela** had given them actual [[Die Titanier|Titanian]] names, inspired by how they were found, Debrann resolved on also giving them "proper normal" names as well. That is why they all have second names as well.
Debrann tries to deal with and treat all his children equally. He has a certain opinion on how children should think and behave and equally teaches his values for all of them. He leaves the ironing out of individual personalities to **Mayra**.
- [[Kyashi Naidesh I|Kyashi]] the eldest, who's already an adult
- [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]], the next younger
- [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin]] the older son
- [[Forashi Naidesh|Forashi]] the younger son

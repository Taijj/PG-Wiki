# Psychological

Jin Naidesh is a versatile person who's fun to be around. Unfortunately, his worth and strengths are hidden from him behind a great deal of insecurity, which often shows as anger. 
#### Flaws
Any tasks Jin takes on - be it for his work, his family, friends or even personal projects - turn into duties for him. He takes these duties very seriously and tries not only to fulfill them, but fulfill them at least flawlessly. However, he does not take pride in a task fulfilled like this. For him, this is the standard and nothing special. That is also why he doesn't take compliments well and waves them off instead.

Deep inside himself, he has a great fear of failing. To fail means to face punishment. Executing a task AT LEAST perfectly is the lowest acceptable outcome. Everything else would not be enough. The feeling of not being enough drives him to always try his hardest. Always!

He's so busy dutifully doing what he thinks is expected of him, that he never developed a great confidence in himself. This is paired with a deep worry about future problems that might never occur, which brings him to constantly question his decisions. He also prefers to let other people make decisions and keeps his opinions to himself, if others share theirs.

These fears drive him to be very impatient and to quickly get angry, if things don't go according to his plans. He stresses out easily and might even turn to physical violence against inanimate objects in these situations.  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Perfectionistic|Short Fused|Hidden Self Doubt|
|Impatient|High Standards|Pessimistic|
|Rigorous|Restless|Hardly accepts Help|
|Sour Loser|Easily Stressed|Hard to Compliment|
|Workaholic|Self-critic|Hard to please/impress|


#### Strengths
Contrary to what he himself believes, Jin is a very structured, responsible, and reliable person, who gets a lot done exceptionally well. In general he's also honest, accepting and kind towards others, with a great readiness to help. He is quick on the uptaking, shines with specialized knowledge, and even has a great sense of humor.

In spite of his frequent anger outbursts, people generally like to hang out or be around him. They might even occasionally seek out his advice, which is often heeded.

# Social

#### Family

The Naidesh Family:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Mother: Rafaela|Father: Varn|
|Sister: Tashi|Brother: Forashi|
|Sister: Toruco|Brother: Mao|
|Sister: Kyashi||

  

- True Mother: Titania
    
- True Father: Jin-Ban
    

  

The Family band

Jin's parents put it into their head to form a family orchestra, since Rafaela played the viola and Varn the clarinet. When each of their children turned 7 they made them choose an instrument. They planned on classical instruments and presented them with a selection. That plan failed as Jin used their carelessness when formulating their demands to him.

They told him "You may choose any instrument you like" and forgot to add "from this list". So Jin chose the electric guitar. After some back and forth they stood to their word, and instead of an orchestra, the family formed some kind of symphonic band:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Rafaela - Viola|Mao - String Bass|Tashi - Violin|
|Kayashi - Piano|Varn - Clarinet|Toruco - Flute|
|Jin - Electric Guitar|Forashi - Drums||

  
  

#### Relationships & Friendships

- The members of the Naidesh Family love and care for each other, they help wherever needed and never hesitate to do so - Jin oftentimes relies on them when he needs help at Ämber
    

- Jin loved his deceased foster parents very much, their loss hit him really hard
    
- He quickly developed a big brother complex for his younger sister Tashi, which he sometimes still treats like a child. Her working at Ämber is a welcome excuse for him to keep an eye on her
    
- He similarly treats the youngest of the bunch, Forashi, who tends to be very childish at times
    
- Toruco, who's older than him, became kind of his family-nemesis after Mao left. Both of them like to provoke each other into fights and challenges
    
- Mao, his oldest brother used to be Jin's role model, until Jin caught him with his dead parents. Now Jin sees him as his mortal enemy.
    
- Kyashi, the oldest, was forced into the mother role for the Family. She took care of her younger siblings. In return Jin stays under one roof with her to help her with her disability.
    

- During his days at the Haarafir school Sora was his best friend. Unfortunately Sora vanished without a trace one day.
    
- During his military days, he met a teyan woman by the name of Neni, which he fell in love with. Unfortunately their differences caused Neni to terminate their relationship, which Jin counts as one of his major defeats.
    
- He also tries to keep up with hybrid military activities. He still got some friends there, who keep him posted about major things. Like Neni's Father, who trained Jin for a long time.

- He can't stand being interrupted during an explanation, order oder speech
    
- His general confidence is strong, even in unfamiliar situations
    
- He doesn't have problems with making decisions or coming up with an opinion
    
- To others he might seem upfront and aggressiv, even threatening
    
- Although he hates losing, there are very rare occasions, when he's okay with losing: If he fights an opponent who's on the same level of skill as he is, and the outcome is dictated by who's making the first error.
    

  

#### Hobbies

- Jin likes to do sports, especially building strength, but he's doing supportive endurance, agility, and mysticism exercises, too.
    
- To clear his head, he likes to climb the Frafir or go on walks about the mountain paths
    
- After a good day of working and working out he occasionally enjoys a book, movie or at times even a video game - but those occasions are rare
    
- On very rare occasions he might take out his old electirc guitar and jam a little. Usually he doesn't get past the point of tuning the thing, though. 
    

  

#### Pets

The Naidesh Family has a family cat, which is still around. Her name is Mrs. Sunshine, and she's a Faró. Jin likes her more than he likes to admit. Kyashi is her primary caretaker, though.

  

#### Habits

- Jin is used to eat 5 meals a day to keep his strength, he even adds little snacks in between those
    
- He likes to have an ample, sweet breakfast. He even uses company money to provide one for his employees and himself
    
- He usually works overtime and fills breaks or free spots in his planner with spontaneous exercising
    
- When he's frustrated he likes to impulse buy cool things. Those things increase in price with the level of frustration he wants to defeat. He got his car that way.
    

  

#### Hygiene

- He might not sweat, but his sweat-smoke really stinks, there's nothing he can do about this with washing, so he tries to cover it up with lots of deodorant
    
- He's proud of his teeth so he keeps them especially clean, shortly brushing them after every meal, and he visits the dentist often
    

  
  

#### Speech & Gestures

Jin has a relatively loud voice, that gets even louder when excited. He speaks a standard language, with rare colloquial terms in between. When angered, his speech turns into a conglomeration of curse words and insults, though.

  
  
  

# Life Story

Jin's story is strongly tied to the story of the so called "capsule kids".

  

- Mother always wanted children and took the 6 in, father not so much. Nevertheless he stepped in, when the mother was killed and more or less took them in. He doesn't know how to parent, though…
    

- After moving away, Jin came back to Haarafir to buy their old house back.
    

- Tries to solve the mystery of his mother/parent's murder and Mao's disappearance. Mao's appearance is a clue. (Not revenge, but strong interest)

# Physical
As a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]] he has the appearance of a male teenage humanoid fox. His body hair is fiery red, while his skin has a rather dark brown coloring (peanut). The natural color of his eyes is green.
## Appearance
His body is rather slim and not too muscular, but firm and well trained nonetheless. He wears his hair in a not too long and rather unkempt [shag haircut](https://www.thetrendspotter.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shag-Haircut-1.jpg) and he has a bushy tail and fox ears. His eyes have a thin shape, but they are by no means small. He's got a defined, pointy jawline with a normal sized mouth - no facial hair.
## Apparel & Accessoires
Jin dressing style is basically non-existent, that is to say: It is very simple. Usually he wears mono colored sweaters, hoodies, t-shirts, or jeans with cheap trainers. On cold days, he likes to put a t-shirt over a sweater to have some color variety. The coloring of his clothes is very soft and modest. His clothes, with his shoes being the exception are usually hand-me-downs from his older siblings (especially Mao, but he doesn't know that).
His best clothes are the ones he wears for [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], which is a dark-almost-black green business suit, a white shirt, and differently colored ties.
## Hygiene
He is actually not bothered much with taking care of himself. Other than taking a bath twice a week before church, brushing his teeth in the morning and before bed, and splashing his face with water in the morning, he doesn't do much personal hygiene. He also somehow never learned the value of deodorant, which makes his natural fragrance to come out at times, which could be much worse, but is not a pleasant smell in any case.
# Personality
The young Jin is a very modest, shy, and reticent person in general. In familiar surroundings he's more outgoing and proactive. He's a very religious person whose faith dictates his views on right and wrong.
## Flaws
Jin is very insecure about himself and his own true opinions and views. He avoids making mistakes like the plague, and tries to please everyone, especially people in positions of authority. He's got a great fear of failing. To fail deserves punishment.
That is why executing a task AT LEAST perfectly is the lowest acceptable outcome for him. Everything else is not enough. The feeling of not being enough drives him to always go above and beyond. This is also the reason why he's very bad at taking compliments.

His fears, standards, and the repression of his own passions drive him to be rather impatient and to often lash out in anger, if things don't go his way. 
## Strengths
Contrary to what he believes himself, Jin is a very structured, responsible, and reliable person, who gets a lot done well. In general he's also honest, accepting and kind towards others, with a great readiness to help. He is quick on the uptake, shines with specialized knowledge, and even has a great sense of humor.
He is also very passionate, if he allows himself to be. In spite of his frequent anger outbursts, people generally like to hang out or be around him.
## Spiritual Beliefs
His entire family are active members of the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]]. His parents are rather strict and its important to them that their children follow the **Nethiel** doctrine. So it is an integral part of Jin's life and he tries very hard to be a good soul, too.
He is very active in their congregation, sings in the choir, plays in the orchestra, and takes on administrative tasks. He prioritizes the church and his faith above everything else, even though there are major aspects of the doctrine he dislikes and can't understand.

# Personal
School and the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] keep him busy most of the week. It is usually bearable, but some weeks he doesn't have a single evening for himself.
## Spare Time
After school, he's often picked up by [[Aunt Nia]] for training. Nia is training him and his siblings in martial arts, armed combat, and she's teaching them on how to use their [[Die Elemente|elemental]] abilities. The training is hard, but Jin does rather enjoy it.
In the little time he has left, he's either playing Videogames alone or with his best and only friend [[Tari (Teen)|Tari]], if they are allowed to. If not, they try to come up with other things to do, which turns out differently most of the time.
## Habits
- His breakfast consists of a bowl of cereal, or sweet spreads on toast, and milk.
- He prays before every meal, even when on his own, e.g. before bed, but in public he tries to do it quickly and in as inconspicuous as possible.
- He likes to take care of his homework or other chores as soon as possible.
- He often daydreams in school or even in church.
## Speech & Gestures
Jin likes to stay rather quite in big groups. Especially, if he doesn't know most people there, or if there are already other louder people present. He generally gives short answers, but with the right questions he can also monologue on for a while. At times he tends to mumble a bit. His demeaner is rather passive and non-provocative, except when he gets angry. Then it changes to threatening.
# Social
Jin's entire social circle is basically made up of the people he knows from [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] and his family.
## Family
Officially, Jin's a normal young [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] living in [[Haarafir]]. In reality, he's a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]], but neither he, nor his siblings know of their heritage. His true parents are similarly unimportant at the current stage of his life.
#### Mother
His mother, [[Raphaela Naidesh]], was a [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]]-[[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] women. Sadly she died in a car accident when he was 8 years old. About 2 years later, his father fell in love with and married [[Mayra Naidesh]], which became the family's stepmother.

#### Father
[[Debrann Naidesh]] is the father of the family. He's a [[Die Forasier|Forasian]]-[[Die Teyaner|Teyan]] hybrid man

His middle Name "Bill" originates from the ancient forasian Name "Biløc", which means "little flame", his foster mother selected this name for him

#### Siblings






The Naidesh Family:

|                 |                  |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Mother: Rafaela | Father: Varn     |
| Sister: Tashi   | Brother: Forashi |
| Sister: Toruco  | Brother: Mao     |
| Sister: Kyashi  |                  |
- True Mother: Titania    
- True Father: Jin-Ban   

## Family Residence

## The Family band

Jin's parents put it into their head to form a family orchestra, since Rafaela played the viola and Varn the clarinet. When each of their children turned 7 they made them choose an instrument. They planned on classical instruments and presented them with a selection. That plan failed as Jin used their carelessness when formulating their demands to him.

They told him "You may choose any instrument you like" and forgot to add "from this list". So Jin chose the electric guitar. After some back and forth they stood to their word, and instead of an orchestra, the family formed some kind of symphonic band:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Rafaela - Viola|Mao - String Bass|Tashi - Violin|
|Kayashi - Piano|Varn - Clarinet|Toruco - Flute|
|Jin - Electric Guitar|Forashi - Drums||

 
## Relationships & Friendships

- The members of the Naidesh Family love and care for each other, they help wherever needed and never hesitate to do so - Jin oftentimes relies on them when he needs help at Ämber
    

- Jin loved his deceased foster parents very much, their loss hit him really hard
    
- He quickly developed a big brother complex for his younger sister Tashi, which he sometimes still treats like a child. Her working at Ämber is a welcome excuse for him to keep an eye on her
    
- He similarly treats the youngest of the bunch, Forashi, who tends to be very childish at times
    
- Toruco, who's older than him, became kind of his family-nemesis after Mao left. Both of them like to provoke each other into fights and challenges
    
- Mao, his oldest brother used to be Jin's role model, until Jin caught him with his dead parents. Now Jin sees him as his mortal enemy.
    
- Kyashi, the oldest, was forced into the mother role for the Family. She took care of her younger siblings. In return Jin stays under one roof with her to help her with her disability.
    

- During his days at the Haarafir school Sora was his best friend. Unfortunately Sora vanished without a trace one day.
    
- During his military days, he met a teyan woman by the name of Neni, which he fell in love with. Unfortunately their differences caused Neni to terminate their relationship, which Jin counts as one of his major defeats.
    
- He also tries to keep up with hybrid military activities. He still got some friends there, who keep him posted about major things. Like Neni's Father, who trained Jin for a long time.

# Physical
As a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]] he has the appearance of a male teenage humanoid fox. His body hair is fiery red, while his skin has a rather dark brown coloring (peanut). The natural color of his eyes is green.
## Appearance
His body is rather slim and not too muscular, but firm and well trained nonetheless. He wears his hair in a not too long and rather unkempt [shag haircut](https://www.thetrendspotter.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shag-Haircut-1.jpg) and he has a bushy tail and fox ears. His eyes have a thin shape, but they are by no means small. He's got a defined, pointy jawline with a normal sized mouth. Strangely enough, he's got no facial hair as of yet.
## Apparel & Accessoires
- He likes to dress himself simply and functional    
- He usually wears camouflage pants, and firm military boots    
- He likes to wear single colored muscle shirts, if necessary he puts on a loose military jacket    
- Around his neck hangs a chain with his soldier's tags    
- He wears a vest like contraption of strips and belts, in which he stores the Ammo for Eksblad. On the back are Magnets that are able to hold Eksblad on his back.
## More
- On his right shoulder he wears a Tattoo, showing a flaming fox surrounding the teyan symbol for the number 4 - this was the logo of the military division he served before he joined the elite, and he had a major part in its design    
- He doesn't sweat, instead he emits visible smoke under effort. He also does that if he gets wet
- His tears are like oil, dark, rather thick, and flammable    
- When he sneezes, smaller random things in his environment tend to explode    
- His coughs are usually accompanied by small puffs o
- 
- f smoke


#### Hygiene

- Doesn't bother too much
- He might not sweat, but his sweat-smoke really stinks, there's nothing he can do about this with washing, so he tries to cover it up with lots of deodorant
    
- He's proud of his teeth so he keeps them especially clean, shortly brushing them after every meal, and he visits the dentist often
## Illnesses & Physical Weaknesses
- He's a choleric with anger issues    
- He has occasional depressive episodes and nightmares almost every night, resulting from the loss of his foster parents and resulting in a lot of sleep deprivation    
- Rain and cold moist environments make him dizzy and inattentive

# Personality
The young Jin is a very modest, shy, and reticent person in general. In familiar surroundings he's more outgoing and proactive. He's a very religious person whose faith dictates his views on right and wrong.
## Flaws
Jin is very insecure about himself and his own true opinions and views. He avoids making mistakes like the plague, and tries to please everyone, especially people in positions of authority. He's got a great fear of failing. To fail deserves punishment.
That is why executing a task AT LEAST perfectly is the lowest acceptable outcome for him. Everything else is not enough. The feeling of not being enough drives him to always go above and beyond. This is also the reason why he's very bad at taking compliments.

His fears, standards, and the repression of his own passions drive him to be rather impatient and to often lash out in anger, if things don't go his way. 
## Strengths
Contrary to what he believes himself, Jin is a very structured, responsible, and reliable person, who gets a lot done well. In general he's also honest, accepting and kind towards others, with a great readiness to help. He is quick on the uptake, shines with specialized knowledge, and even has a great sense of humor.
He is also very passionate, if he allows himself to be. In spite of his frequent anger outbursts, people generally like to hang out or be around him.

#### Spiritual Beliefs

- Jin adapts a rather agnostic worldview
    
- He generally doesn't care, if higher forces are at play, and rather trusts his own strengths and reasoning
    
- He generally has respect for the beliefs and values of others, until someone gets hurt, or his views on right and wrong get violated
    

  

#### Social Aptitudes & Manners

- Jin values a firm handshake between strangers, as a first greeting, like nothing else
    
- He can't stand being interrupted during an explanation, order oder speech
    
- His general confidence is strong, even in unfamiliar situations
    
- He doesn't have problems with making decisions or coming up with an opinion
    
- To others he might seem upfront and aggressiv, even threatening
    
- Although he hates losing, there are very rare occasions, when he's okay with losing: If he fights an opponent who's on the same level of skill as he is, and the outcome is dictated by who's making the first error.

# Personal
#### Hobbies

- Jin likes to do sports, especially building strength, but he's doing supportive endurance, agility, and mysticism exercises, too.
    
- To clear his head, he likes to climb the Frafir or go on walks about the mountain paths
    
- After a good day of working and working out he occasionally enjoys a book, movie or at times even a video game - but those occasions are rare
    
- On very rare occasions he might take out his old electirc guitar and jam a little. Usually he doesn't get past the point of tuning the thing, though. 
    

  

#### Pets

The Naidesh Family has a family cat, which is still around. Her name is Mrs. Sunshine, and she's a Faró. Jin likes her more than he likes to admit. Kyashi is her primary caretaker, though.

  

#### Habits

- Jin is used to eat 5 meals a day to keep his strength, he even adds little snacks in between those
    
- He likes to have an ample, sweet breakfast. He even uses company money to provide one for his employees and himself
    
- He usually works overtime and fills breaks or free spots in his planner with spontaneous exercising
    
- When he's frustrated he likes to impulse buy cool things. Those things increase in price with the level of frustration he wants to defeat. He got his car that way.
    

  


    

  
  

#### Speech & Gestures

Jin has a relatively loud voice, that gets even louder when excited. He speaks a standard language, with rare colloquial terms in between. When angered, his speech turns into a conglomeration of curse words and insults, though.


- His middle Name "Bill" originates from the ancient forasian Name "Biløc", which means "little flame", his foster mother selected this name for him
- His capsule, along with the ones from his siblings, was discovered by members of the Haarafir Science Department, who managed to get him out of stasis on the 28.02.2128
- He's an active [[The Nethiel Church]]
# Social

#### Family
Officially he's a normal young [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] man living in [[Haarafir]]., but actually.

The Naidesh Family:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Mother: Rafaela|Father: Varn|
|Sister: Tashi|Brother: Forashi|
|Sister: Toruco|Brother: Mao|
|Sister: Kyashi||

  

- True Mother: Titania
    
- True Father: Jin-Ban
    

Family Residence


The Family band

Jin's parents put it into their head to form a family orchestra, since Rafaela played the viola and Varn the clarinet. When each of their children turned 7 they made them choose an instrument. They planned on classical instruments and presented them with a selection. That plan failed as Jin used their carelessness when formulating their demands to him.

They told him "You may choose any instrument you like" and forgot to add "from this list". So Jin chose the electric guitar. After some back and forth they stood to their word, and instead of an orchestra, the family formed some kind of symphonic band:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Rafaela - Viola|Mao - String Bass|Tashi - Violin|
|Kayashi - Piano|Varn - Clarinet|Toruco - Flute|
|Jin - Electric Guitar|Forashi - Drums||

  
  

#### Relationships & Friendships

- The members of the Naidesh Family love and care for each other, they help wherever needed and never hesitate to do so - Jin oftentimes relies on them when he needs help at Ämber
    

- Jin loved his deceased foster parents very much, their loss hit him really hard
    
- He quickly developed a big brother complex for his younger sister Tashi, which he sometimes still treats like a child. Her working at Ämber is a welcome excuse for him to keep an eye on her
    
- He similarly treats the youngest of the bunch, Forashi, who tends to be very childish at times
    
- Toruco, who's older than him, became kind of his family-nemesis after Mao left. Both of them like to provoke each other into fights and challenges
    
- Mao, his oldest brother used to be Jin's role model, until Jin caught him with his dead parents. Now Jin sees him as his mortal enemy.
    
- Kyashi, the oldest, was forced into the mother role for the Family. She took care of her younger siblings. In return Jin stays under one roof with her to help her with her disability.
    

- During his days at the Haarafir school Sora was his best friend. Unfortunately Sora vanished without a trace one day.
    
- During his military days, he met a teyan woman by the name of Neni, which he fell in love with. Unfortunately their differences caused Neni to terminate their relationship, which Jin counts as one of his major defeats.
    
- He also tries to keep up with hybrid military activities. He still got some friends there, who keep him posted about major things. Like Neni's Father, who trained Jin for a long time.

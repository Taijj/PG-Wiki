# Physical
As the youngest family member and a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]], she has the appearance of a humanoid preteen husky. She likes to wear blueish blouses and jeans, and pretty dresses to [[#Personality|church]], mostly in blue as well. Her fur is red, her skin dark, and her eyes have a deep vibrant blue. Coupled with her energetic demeanor she radiates a sassy attitude.
# Personality
Tashi likes to act tough and tempered. These acts lack the necessary substance and conviction, though, and the facade crumbles and her insecurities show. Deep down Tashi is a gentle, caring, sensitive, and empathic character, who is impressed by the values she tries to act out, namely toughness, conviction, and responsibility.
She's yet too young to think deeply about spirituality and faith. For her the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel Church]] just belongs to everyday life.
# Personal
The things she finds most interesting is how different substances interact, react, and mix together. What science calls chemistry, her [[Mayra Naidesh|stepmother]] fosters as cooking and baking. That way, Tashi already became rather competent in the kitchen, and she still likes to mush random stuff together during her spare time.
The training with [[Aunt Nia]] oftentimes comes as a nuisance for her. She will go along, but she will also be eager to complain the whole time.
Tashi's speech is rather colloquial and usually sounds cocky, at least up until someone gets really upset. Then she turns motherly all of a sudden.
# Social
She's got a number of play buddies in [[#Professional|school]] and around the neighborhood, but her friendships aren't that deep, yet. Her great role models are the big "women" in her life, namely [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]] and [[Wirbelwind Falkenfeder I|Wirbelwind]] - [[Kyashi Naidesh I|Kyashi]] and [[Aunt Nia]], too, to some degree. Additionally, she's also fond of the occasional alone time.
# Professional
Tashi still goes to [[The Institute of Science#FUN(damental) School|FUN school]], but it is suspected she might be graduating soon. She's an average student with a knack for sports and science and will most likely join her brothers on **Enjar MID** after she graduated. <- Redconned! She actually already is in MID school!

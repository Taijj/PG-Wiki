## Spiritual Beliefs
All members of his family are believers in the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] faith. His parents are rather strict and its important to them that their children follow that doctrine. So it is an integral and important part of Jin's life, and he tries very hard to live up to these beliefs.
He is very active in their congregation, sings in the choir, plays in the orchestra, and takes on administrative tasks. He prioritizes the church and his faith above everything else, even though there are major aspects of the doctrine he dislikes and can't understand.

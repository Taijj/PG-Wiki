# Physical
As a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]] he has the appearance of a male teenage humanoid fox. His body hair is fiery red, while his skin has a rather dark brown coloring (peanut). The default color of his eyes is green.
His body is rather slim and not too muscular, but firm and well trained nonetheless. He wears his hair in a not too long and rather unkempt [shag haircut](https://www.thetrendspotter.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shag-Haircut-1.jpg), and he has a bushy tail and fox ears. His eyes have a thin shape, but they are by no means small. He's got a defined, pointy jawline with a normal sized mouth - no facial hair.
## Apparel & Accessoires
Jin's dressing style is basically non-existent, that is to say: It is very simple. Usually he wears mono colored sweaters, hoodies, t-shirts, or jeans with cheap trainers. The coloring of his cloths is very soft, modest or dark. The motifs are random, and usually make no sense to him or anyone else. His clothes, with his shoes being the exception, are usually hand-me-downs from his older siblings (especially [[#Siblings|Mao]], but he doesn't know that). If he can, he puts on pants and shorts with additional side bags. His keys usually reside in his left pocket, attached to his pants by a short keychain. A red lanyard is also attached to the keys, which he lets hang from the pocket then.
His best clothes are the ones he wears for [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], which is a dark-almost-black green business suit, a white shirt, and differently colored ties.
## Hygiene
He is actually not bothered much with taking care of himself. Other than taking a bath twice a week before church, brushing his teeth in the morning and before bed, and splashing his face with water in the morning, he doesn't do much personal hygiene. He also somehow never learned the value of deodorant, which makes his natural fragrance to come out at times. His body odor could be much worse, but is not a pleasant smell in any case.
## Enhanced Senses
Some [[Die Teyaner|Teyan]] part, from deep deep within his ancestry, caused him to have an enhanced sense and a sensibility for feeling [[Die Seele#Die Aura|Auras]]. To date this is nothing more than random sensations he feels from time to time, though, and he mostly interprets them as [[#Spiritual Beliefs|divine signs from the Light]]. To actually be useful he'd have to focus and train his senses, but so far he didn't get that idea.
# Personality
The young Jin is a very modest, shy, and reticent person in general. In familiar surroundings he's more outgoing and proactive. He's a very religious person whose faith dictates his views on right and wrong.
## Flaws
Jin is very insecure about himself and his own true opinions and views. He avoids making mistakes like the plague, and tries to please everyone, especially people in positions of authority. He's got a great fear of failing. To fail deserves punishment.
That is why executing a task AT LEAST perfectly is the lowest acceptable outcome for him. Everything else is not enough. The feeling of not being enough drives him to always go above and beyond. This is also the reason why he's very bad at taking compliments.

His fears, standards, and the repression of his own passions drive him to be rather impatient and to often lash out in anger, if things don't go his way. 
## Strengths
Contrary to what he believes himself, Jin is a very structured, responsible, and reliable person, who gets a lot done well. In general he's also honest, accepting and kind towards others, with a great readiness to help. He is quick on the uptake, shines with specialized knowledge, and even has a great sense of humor.
He is also very passionate, if he allows himself to be. In spite of his frequent anger outbursts, people generally like to hang out or be around him.
## Spiritual Beliefs
All members of his family are believers in the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] faith. His parents are rather strict and its important to them that their children follow that doctrine. So it is an integral and important part of Jin's life, and he tries very hard to live up to these beliefs.
He is very active in their congregation, sings in the choir, plays in the orchestra, and takes on administrative tasks. He prioritizes the church and his faith above everything else, even though there are major aspects of the doctrine he dislikes and can't understand.

# Personal
School and the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] keep him busy most of the week. It is usually bearable, but some weeks he doesn't have a single evening for himself.
## Spare Time
After school, he's often picked up by [[Aunt Nia]] for training. Nia is training him and his siblings in martial arts, armed combat, and she's teaching them on how to use their [[Die Elemente|elemental]] abilities. The training is hard, but Jin does rather enjoy it.
In the little time he has left, he's either playing videogames alone or with his best and only friend [[Tarmael Curan I|Tari]], if they are allowed to. If not, they try to come up with other things to do, which turns out differently most of the time.
## Habits
- His breakfast consists of a bowl of cereal, or sweet spreads on toast, and milk.
- He prays before every meal, even when on his own, e.g. before bed, but in public he tries to do it quickly and in a way as inconspicuous as possible.
- He likes to take care of his homework or other chores as soon as possible.
- He often daydreams in school or even in church.
## Speech & Gestures
Jin likes to stay rather quite in big groups. Especially, if he doesn't know most people there, or if there are already other louder people present. He generally gives short answers, but with the right questions he can also monologue on for a while. At times he tends to mumble a bit. His demeaner is rather passive and non-provocative, except when he gets angry. Then it changes to threatening.
# Social
Jin's entire social circle is basically made up of the people he knows from [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] and his family.
## Family
Officially, Jin's a normal young [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] living in [[Haarafir]]. In reality, he's a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]], but neither he, nor his siblings know of their heritage and at this stage of his life, his true origins don't really matter.
### Members
At the moment, the Naidesh family consist of 7 members.
#### Mother
His mother, [[Raphaela Naidesh]], was a [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]]-[[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] women. Sadly she died in a car accident when he was 8 years old. About 2 years later, his father fell in love with and married [[Mayra Naidesh]], which became the family's stepmother. **Mayra** does not know the truth about her stepchildren either.
**Mayra** is a pretty strict and conservative women. She's the leader of their [[#Spiritual Beliefs|congregation]] and fulfills her duties sternly, diligently, and with special attention to their family's reputation. She's a real contrast to the kind and free-spirited **Raphaela**. Jin thinks he has respect for her, but in truth, he's terrified.
#### Father
[[Debrann Naidesh]] is the father of the family. He's a [[Die Forasier|Forasian]]-[[Die Teyaner|Teyan]] man and the only one in the family who has some kind of a clue of what his children are.
He's usually a very reserved man, but with strong and conservative opinions about right and wrong. His faith means everything to him. He strives to talk about it as much as possible and gets angry with his children, if they don't treat it seriously enough.
#### Siblings
Jin's got 3 sisters and 2 brothers:
- [[Kyashi Naidesh I|Kyashi]] is the eldest sister, who's bound to a wheelchair. She's a rather quite women, but also likes to crack jokes about her disability. Jin loves to talk and spend time with her, and helps, even if she's perfectly capable of taking care of herself.
- [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]] is his next older sister, who likes to challenge and tease him. Toruco's a tough girl, who doesn't take shit from anyone. With the exception of their parents. Still, she's generally the rebellious one in the family.
- [[Forashi Naidesh|Forashi]] is the younger brother with which Jin enjoys a happy rivalry, be it training, games, or even chores. He's a very levelheaded person, who draws conclusions from his own thoughts, and loves to argue people into the ground.
- [[Tashi Naidesh I|Tashi]] the youngest is a kind girl who likes to act wild and tough, literally falling short by her appearance (she's not only the youngest but also the smallest). For Jin, she's pretty much the standard little sister to love and protect.
- **Mao**, his older brother, disappeared when [[#Mother|Raphaela]] died and circumstances forced the family to forget about him. At this time, its like he never even existed.
### Family Residence
The family used to have a nice house in the living district of [[Haarafir]], close to the [[Marros]]. But they moved to an appartement closer to the city center, shortly after [[#Father|Debrann]] met and married [[#Mother|Mayra]]. The appartement is much smaller, but roomy enough to house them all. The children have to share rooms, though.
The two older ones, **Toruco** and Jin, share a room, and the two younger ones, **Tashi** and **Forashi**, share another. Kyashi has her own room, she's the oldest and needs more space due to her disability.
She is about to move out though. [[Aunt Nia]], who bought off the old house from **Debrann**, made sure it will be available for them, if they ever decided to move back there. **Kyashi** is taking her up on that offer soon.
### The Family Band
As the children of their congregation's [[The Nethiel Church#Additional Responsibilities|Matron]], it is their duty to praise and worship their goddess with the gifts they were given. Namely a voice and hands as tools to make holy music. Shortly after their stepmother came into their lives, the parents sat each of their children down, all but forced their children to learn an instrument, and to join the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] choir.
They offered them a free choice of instrument, though, and in the end they had a something like a little family band going:

| **Kyashi** | Piano  | **Jin**     | Base Guitar | **Tashi** | Violin |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ------ |
| **Toruco** | Guitar | **Forashi** | Saxophone   |           |        |
The band sometimes plays on its own, too, but they mostly make up the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]] orchestra, along with other members of the congregation. The parents themselves also participate in the choir, but they don't play any instrument.
## Relationships & Friendships
Jin's best friend is [[Tarmael Curan I|Tari]], a [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] boy he knows from [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]]. They both met after the Naideshs had moved, which also caused them to switch congregations. They quickly connected over their love for videogames and vivid imaginations.
Jin also has a small crush on [[NADINE]], a [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]]-[[Die Forasier|Forasian]] girl also from **church**. Other than the **church**-youth, he's got no further social connections, though.

In school he is very reticent and shy. Deep down he thinks everyone hates him, and he's quietly judging everyone on this basis. He also heavily prioritizes **church** over everything else in his life, and rarely has time to spend with people from "the outside".
# Professional
Jin has not reached [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|adulthood]], yet, and therefore still has to go to school. He's currently visiting the **Enjar MID School**, a [[The Institute of Science#MID(dle) School|Middle School]] near to where the Naideshs live.
## School
Jin and his siblings were subconsciously raised to give their best at everything they do. For their parents this mainly applies to everything related to their [[#Spiritual Beliefs|faith]], but it also extends to their school grades. Their stepmother is especially concerned with them passing all their classes as soon as possible, with passable grades - not just barely. She also sternly encourages them to use their learning years as efficiently as possible.
For Jin, this results in him basically maxing out his school's timetable by filling it with all the optional classes he can cram in. He's one of the rare pupils who has a full 28 hour school week. 
These are the subjects he has chosen (# of classes a week):
- **Logical**: Mathematics(3) + Informatics(2)
- **Languages**: [[COMMON]](3) + [[Nerivanisch|Nerivan]](3)
- **Natural**: Physics(2) + [[The Institute of Science#Section IV|Anomiology]](2) + Chemistry(2)
- **Artistic**: Advanced Arts & Crafts(3) 
- **Cultural**: Bardeenian History(2)
- **Physical**: Gymnastics(3)
- **Mystic**: Elemental Mysticism(2)
## Intellectual Features
Jin's generally a quick study. He does not need to study much to achieve passable grades, since he focuses a lot on paying attention in class. He's by no means a model student, though. Occasionally he also starts daydreaming in class. He's careful in his tasks and fulfills them conscientiously, and he's very structured in his approach.
## Additional Skills
Due to the training with [[Aunt Nia]], he already acquired fundamental skills in armed and unarmed combat, as well as the ability to summon basic [[Die Mystik#Beschw√∂rungen|elemental animations]]. This also comes with the benefit of doing a lot of sports, and having an above average level of fitness.

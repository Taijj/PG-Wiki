# Physical
The most obvious thing about her is the wheelchair under her butt. The same accident that caused her [[Raphaela Naidesh|mother]]'s death permanently altered her ability to walk. She can still somewhat use her legs, though. For a short time she can stand and even do one or two shacky steps, but then she will slump over again.
As a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]], she has the appearance of a young female humanoid dingo. Her fur is bright blonde, her skin dark brown, and her eyes bright green. The pointy ears and tail conclude the picture. The [[#Personal|training]] with [[Aunt Nia]] keeps her body physically fit, in spite of her spending a lot of time in the chair.
# Personality
She also belongs to the rather kind and quite types. She does have her own head and a strong will, though. She just learned to slow things down a bit, which often comes of as disinterest. Inside that quite exterior lives a very passionate and creative soul, with a great sense of humor. (She really likes to make jokes about her own disability.)
Kyashi somewhat does believes in the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] doctrine, but is not too strict about it. She believes in the [[The Nethiel Church#The Light|Light]] and also speaks her regular personal prayers, but has serious doubts about the roles of its "mortal representatives". She really loves to make the floral decorations for the [[The Nethiel Church#Churches|altar]], though.
# Personal
Kyashi is actually about to leave the family appartement to move back into their old house. [[Aunt Nia]], the current owner, kept it for this exact reason: In case any of the children would like to move back there as adults. Kyashi is currently on the hunt for a new [[#Professional|job]], too. She's looking for something not too far from the house, and will move there as soon as she found an occupation she likes.
She absolutely loves growing, tending to, and arranging plants. The little selection of vegetables and flowers in pots, on the appartement balcony, are her doing. Creating elaborate flower arrangements is her way of acting out her creative energies.
In spite of her wheelchair, or because of it, she also gets training from [[Aunt Nia]]. In addition to keeping her fit, it also enables her to basically take care of herself. Being independent of anyone else, is something she cherishes deeply.
Kyashi has a clear, friendly voice. She doesn't talk much, but if she does, a well formed standard speech comes out.
# Social
During the last year of school **Hennrick Buschwinkel**, a fellow student, became her boyfriend. They are a couple for over 3 years now. The [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]]-[[Die Forasier|Forasian]] **Hennrick**, contrary to what his name suggests, has more mathematical interests, though, and doesn't do well with plants.
Besides her boyfriend she also likes to spend time with her siblings, who generally enjoy her company as well.
# Professional
Kyashi is about to finish her 3 year apprenticeship as a florist. That, and her spare time efforts of turning the balcony into a vast impassable jungle, made her quite capable in the field. Since her training is about to end soon, she's currently looking for a job, but hasn't found any she's satisfied with, yet.

# Physical
During this part of her life, (Tita)Nia keeps her hair in a long loosely bound braid. She lets it grow out naturally and only cuts it, if it reaches hip length. She looks middle aged and healthy.
## Apparel & Accessoires
She's usually wearing knee-high boots, fitting leather pants, and a leather jacket for hunting. A small knife is strapped to a belt around her hips, and almost her whole figure is covered by a wide hunting cape. Her clothes are not very revealing and purposefully kept sturdy and functional.
## Hygiene
Even though she lives a [[#Forest Hut|simple life]], she regularly takes care of herself with what nature can offer. She likes to shower in the nearby waterfall or bathe in the adjacent lake to relax and unwind. Once a week, she even tends to her skin and hair with herbs she collects and processes herself. She also uses a self-made herb paste to clean her teeth.
She does have a smell of the forest around her, which is by no means unpleasant.
# Personality
Aunt Nia is a mature and dignified women. She tends to be strict, but also shows a sense of humor at times. She demands respect and radiates authority just be being present. That facade can crumble quickly, though, and then she can show a previously unexpected kindness and tenderness.
# Personal
Nia lives alone, since she's not very fond of large crowds. She also never warmed up to the modern [[Bardeena|Bardeenian]] way of life and prefers to spend most of her time in the wilderness.
## Routine 
During the nights, she's usually out hunting and gathering for food, medicine, cosmetics, or even constructing, if her hut needs repairs.
The days she usually spends tailing one of her charges, namely [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin and his siblings]]. This is the time when they are the most active, and she needs to be the most vigilant. None of the children know, she's doing this, though, and she's aware of how creeped out they'd be, if they knew. Training sessions with them also take place over the days.
## Forest Hut
Nia built herself a nice little hut in the wilderness beyond the [[Haarafir]] city walls. She wants to be close to her charges, but cannot stand the noise and "awakeness" of the city itself. So she searched for a nice place not too far away, but also not too close either.
The hut is made from wood and stone, and consists of only one room. But this room contains all the things, she needs:
- A small kitchen and a fireplace for cooking and brewing,
- a workshop with a little forge for tending to her equipment,
- a little laboratory for alchemy,
- a straw bed on the floor,
- and some shelf to store a few things.
She cuts her own firewood from the forest around the hut. She also sometimes trains her pupils here on specialized forest training courses or on the big sparing grounds nearby. The "restroom" is also outside.
## Speech & Gestures
Nia speaks in direct, short, and clear sentences without much bells and whistles. Her statements often come off as orders and are joined by a certain cockyness. It is hard to impress her and her speech reflects that, too. Often the only thing moving while speaking is her mouth, and the rest of her body stays the way it is.
# Social
She is no stranger to society but has a reputation of being a secretive recluse. Besides the [[Jin Naidesh I#Family|Naidesh Family]], she doesn't have any social contacts whatsoever and prefers to stay in the wilds. She seems to be especially wary of any [[The Bardeena Defense Force|Defense Force]] agents, and has a general aversion to [[Bardeena|Bardeenian]] figures of authority, e.g. school teachers.
## Naidesh Residence
Somehow, she managed to buy the [[Jin Naidesh I#Family Residence|old Naidesh Residence]], after the family moved out. However, it is unclear how exactly she pulled that off.
# More
- Nia doesn't have a fixed sleep schedule. She tries to maximize the observation time of her charges during the day, so she goes in a kind of a rest state during the nights while waiting for prey. She learned to rest while still being pretty aware of her surroundings, and rarely actually goes to bed to sleep.
- She even owns a mobile phone, which is rather useless in the wilds, but barely has reception when she's back in her hut. All the **Naidesh Kids** and their parents have her number to call for emergencies.
- Her hut also seems to have electricity somehow, but how actually is anybody's guess.
- She cannot stand, if the kids go on road or school trips for obvious reasons.
- Early in the mornings, when the suns go up, she likes to meditate near the lake, butt naked.

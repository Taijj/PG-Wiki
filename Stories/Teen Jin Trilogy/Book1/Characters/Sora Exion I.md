# Physical
Sora has the appearance of a rather wild teenage [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] boy. His [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]] side is more dominant than the [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] one, but without wings. His hair starts in a rather saturated [Celeste](https://colors.artyclick.com/color-names-dictionary/color-names/celeste-color)-Blue, and gradually gets darker until it reaches black at the tips. His skin tone is Caucasian, with **Nerivan** patterned spots, and his eyes shine in a [Merigold Yellow](https://colors.artyclick.com/color-names-dictionary/color-names/marigold-yellow-color/). The ears are **Nerivan**, the Legs **Rowagian**, and he's got small horns, which are mostly covered by his hair.
His body is rather thin, but shows signs of physical fitness. A handsome face, constantly shining with a seductive look, sits atop a pointy jaw. Everything is rounded of with his shoulder long voluminous wavy (babe #1) hair.
(His skeleton is **Nerivan**, no double damage disadvantage.)
## Apparel & Accessoires
Sora's dressing style is casual but stylish. He wears mostly dark clothes, with nice colored highlights or tribal motifs. They fit him very well, compliment his figure, and get replaced before they show signs of age or tear. The same is true for his shoes. A visible keychain connects his pants with the keys in his pockets. A simple black wrist watch is attached to his left arm.
All in all, he looks pretty metal.
## Hygiene
Sora does take good care of himself in an appropriate scope. He has no trouble with getting himself dirty, but also cleans up afterwards. He likes to leave a pleasant impression, especially with the opposite sex.
## Enhanced Senses
He's inherited a set of healthy eyes (no glasses) from his [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]] side, but more importantly: He's got near [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] hearing.
# Personality
Sora is a rather outgoing, motivating, and impulsive character in any circumstances. He's impressed and fond of live itself, and tries to really see the person in front of him. Another aspect is his free spirited nature.
## Flaws
Sora doesn't think much about authority, which comes off as being disrespectful, especially towards teachers or parents. He's a rather in-the-moment kind of guy, who likes to do things depending on his current mood. That often makes it hard to rely on him to keep schedules, stick with plans, or meet at an agreed upon time.
He can also be rather careless with his clothing or other equipment, causing things to break sometimes. He's impulsive and follows ideas that not only inconveniences him, but usually also his friends, and he can be very stubborn with that, too.
## Strengths
Sora likes to talk to people, really talk, hear, understand, and learn who they are. He's very attentive, too, often noticing the smallest details in a person's voice or demeanor. He knows how to motivate others and relishes in bringing out the best in them. His passion, laughter, and openness are contagious.
He's a very pleasant and self-confident person, generally a pleasure to have around. He also has no trouble to come up with ideas on how to pass the time in fun ways.
## Spiritual Beliefs
Sora is not a strong believer in spiritual things. He does admit there might be something greater, or some controlling power in the universe, but his life is not influenced much by these beliefs. However, sometimes things just happen to him, which he credits to this controlling power. E.g. like him getting hurt, if he just said something nasty.

# Personal
Sora usually takes the things as they come, without planning or structuring his weeks or even days through.
## Spare Time
After school, he usually stays on campus for a while to study, do homework, or just hang out some more with his school friends. If he doesn't make evening plans with his friends, he goes back home in the late afternoon. That's the time his mom comes back from work, and he likes to help her with chores. The evening he then spends either being lazy (videogames, movies, music), or he's honing his [[Die Elemente|elemental]] skills. He's often content just loafing around outside, though, especially in good weather.
## Habits
- He oversleeps often, which makes him skip breakfast a lot
- His laughter is very loud an honest (which puts off some people)
- Arriving at home, he likes to just drop his things to clean them up later, if at all
## Speech & Gestures
Sora has an honest and direct way of talking. He states things as he sees them and is not afraid to do so. His speech underlines his nonchalant and carefree attitude as well, being generally rather colloquial.
Except when he's holding one of his epic speeches. He likes to do those with a deep voice, epic hand gestures, and power-poses to motivate whoever they are directed towards. He also likes to avoid nicknames, using people's full unabbreviated names instead, even when not in epic-speech-mode.
# Social
Sora is a pretty social guy, and he's got a few friends from school - his [[#Professional|current]] and the previous [[The Institute of Science#FUN(damental) School|FUN]] school - he regularly hangs out with. However, in the current context (*Book I*), these play a neglectable role.
## Family
Sora lives in a small appartement together with his [[#Mother]] near the city center of [[Haarafir]]. 
### Members
There are aunts, uncles, and a grandma nearby, but contextually speaking his family only consists of 2 members.
#### Mother
[[Gwin Exion]] is a kind [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] women, who takes good care of her son alone. Sora prefers to take care of himself most of the time, but he's also happy to be indulged once in a while. He can be pretty rude to her, but loves her very much nonetheless.
#### Father
Sora's father died 8 years ago, and [[#Mother|Gwin]] took care of their son alone since then. As of now (*Book I*) the loss of Sora's father is nothing more than his motivation to train, since he worked for the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Department of Warding|Department of Warding]] and was a very capable fighter before he died.
## Relationships & Friendships
As stated earlier, Sora's current friends are not important as of yet. He neither has any relationships to speak of. He does enjoy the company of and flirting with girls, though, and would generally like to have a girlfriend.
# Professional
Sora has not reached [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|adulthood]], yet, and therefore still has to go to school. He's currently visiting the **Enjar MID School**, a [[The Institute of Science#MID(dle) School|Middle School]] on the other side of town. There would be a school closer to where he lives, but it was already at capacity, when he tried to enroll. Sora doesn't mind the extra commuting, though.
## School
Sora is not the best of students, but he does try to learn as much as he can in his chosen subjects and often studies with his friends. The challenges of his personal life take priority though, and sometimes they interfere with his school duties. Coming in late, or unfinished homework is not a rarity with him.
Sora is happy to get a passing grade to advance through school. He doesn't see any benefits in trying too hard and loosing sleep over bad grades or upcoming exams. Still, he does have occasional bursts of enthusiasm for the classes he has chosen.

Sora's 21 hour week (# of classes a week):
- **Logical**: Mathematics(3)
- **Languages**: [[COMMON]](3) + [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]](3)
- **Natural**: Physics(2)
- **Artistic**: Advanced Arts & Crafts(3) 
- **Cultural**: Bardeenian History(2)
- **Physical**: Athletics(3)
- **Mystic**: Elemental Mysticism(2)
## Intellectual Features
Sora generally learns well, but has trouble understanding complicated logical structures or historical dates (in spite of being generally interested in the subject). He needs to put some effort into studying most of the time, and he really works to pass his classes.
Intellectually he might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but he makes up for it by having a very high emotional intelligence instead.
## Additional Skills
Due to his own training efforts, he managed to teach himself in the basics of [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Animation|elemental animations]] to a level where he has no trouble with [[Die Mystik#Beschwörungen|summoning]] lightning almost effortlessly. He also likes to run far distances (<10km) regularly and has a high endurance.

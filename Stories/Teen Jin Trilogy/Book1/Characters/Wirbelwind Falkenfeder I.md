# Physical
As a young [[Mischlinge|hybrid]] woman, her appearance leans more towards her [[Die Rowagier|Rowagian]] side. The only things [[Die Forasier|Forasian]] about her are her ears, the mouth and chin area, her tail, and the pattern on her skin. Everything else, including her general body shape and her large wings, is **Rowagian**.
She likes to keep her long hair in a bound braid and fine glasses sit on her nose. She has no fixed style of clothing, and likes to wear many and different things.
# Personality
Wirbelwind's whole demeanor radiates cute clumsiness and naivet√©. She does have strong believes, a fixed moral, and a clear vision of what she wants, though. She is a devout [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] and a strong believer in the doctrine. She especially likes to participate in the various musical events and plays an active role in the choirs and orchestras.
She often has trouble finding the right words or getting to the point she wants to make. Then she clumsily talks around the issue until finally someone else makes her point for her. 
# Social
Wirbelwind is best friends with [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]]. She looks up to **Toruco** and is inspired by her maturity.
# Professional
She visits the same school as [[Tarmael Curan I|Tari]], and also likes to hang with him there.

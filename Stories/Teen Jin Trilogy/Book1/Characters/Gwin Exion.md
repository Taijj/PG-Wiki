# Physical
Gwin is a short rather plump [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] women, with a very kind and cute face and shining brown eyes. At home she dresses comfortable in zipped Hoodies and simple sweatpants. At work she dresses business causal, mostly with dark colors. She keeps her antlers short.
# Personality
She's a single mother and diligently takes care of her [[#Social|son]] and anyone he brings home. A welcoming, caring and kind spirit makes up her personality, up to the point of almost spoiling son and friends.
Her cute face always shows a bright smile with a cheeky glitter in her sparkling eyes, and she's quick to laugh. However, in quite moments, the scars of losing her [[#Social|husband]] reveal themselves.
# Personal
Gwin leads a pretty busy live, with taking care of her son alone, going to work, cooking, and doing all the groceries and chores at home. She doesn't mind, though. She even gets a great satisfaction out of her housework. After all her chores, she likes to sit in front of the TV and knit, sow, or do some stitching as a create activity.
She speaks with a bright warm voice and her sentences usually end with a short giggle or a chuckle.
# Social
As a single mother, she doesn't have a lot of capacity for friendships outside her own family. She lives in a small 2 room appartement with her son [[Sora Exion I|Sora]], near the city center of [[Haarafir]]. **Sora** is usually busy with his teenage life, but he also often helps her with her chores, or they play cards together. Gwin's own mother also lives nearby and the two women help each other out once in a while.
8 years ago, Gwin's husband died due to a work accident, and she's taken care of their son alone every since. She still suffers from that loss and sometimes compensates by maybe pampering **Sora** a tad too much. **Sora**'s name was given by his father, while Gwin gave him his second name of *Christopher*.
# Professional
Gwin works as the secretary and personal assistant to her boss in a small administrative office for the [[The National Office#Department of Resources|Department of Resources]]. Her tasks are to answer the telephone, forward and prepare requests for resources, and take care of the office in general.
Gwin is not particularly fond of her job, her coworkers, or her strict boss, but she manages with diligence and dignity.

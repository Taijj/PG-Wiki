# Physical
As a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]], he's got the appearance of a male humanoid teenage polar fox. He likes to mostly dress in black and wears a dark red suit to [[#Personality|church]]. His fur has an azure blue coloring, and his general demeanor seems confident and aloof. 
# Personality
Forashi is usually a very levelheaded person. He values logic and reason above all else, reaches his own conclusions, and can defend them with substantial arguments, if he gets the chance. He's got a bit of trouble with relating to deep emotions and can come off as being harsh, if the feelings of others make no sense to him.
He is an active member of a [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] congregation. That being said, he's not a very devout believer and only goes along, because its a [[#Social|family]] tradition, and his parents all but force him to do it.
# Personal
Forashi is a big fan of pop and nerd culture. He likes to meet up with [[#Social|friends]] and spends a lot of time on the [[The Board of Requirements#The Network|Net]] or play videogames with them. This also gave him a very colloquial speech and a very pleasant sense of humor, riddled with references, of course.
He enjoys the training with [[Aunt Nia]] very much.
# Social
In [[#Professional|school]] he met a small group of people he calls friends. He often hangs out with them at their places, but never brings them home. Speaking of family, he's the next youngest sibling of [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin Naidesh]] with which he enjoys a brotherly rivalry. If they get a chance to play videogames, but with any task really, they push each other to best the other and so far no clear winner has emerged.
# Professional
Forashi visits the same school as [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin]], [[The Institute of Science#MID(dle) School|Enjar MID]] in [[Haarafir]]. He's a pretty good student, progressing faster than the average, especially in the logical subject and even the artistic ones, but lacking behind a tiny bit in the literary or historical ones.

# Physical
Generally, Mayra looks like a normal middle aged women. As a [[Mischlinge|hybrid]], her [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarian]] attributes are more dominant, though. Her whole body is rather **Dragnarian**, with the exception of her impressive [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] antlers, the blue **Nerivan** hair, and patterns on her skin. She wears her hair short in a pixie-like haircut.
## Apparel & Accessoires
Her everyday clothes are softly colored, often with floral patterns or imagery. She usually wears a buttoned blouse, simple cloth pants, and creamy colored Loafers. In [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], she's wearing the minister's [[The Nethiel Church#More|black suit]], like all ministers do.
Small rectangular glasses sit on her nose, while she likes to wear colorful jewelry around her neck and wrists. On her left hand is a golden watch and her wedding ring.
## Hygiene
Mayra takes care to look somewhat presentable every day. She doesn't spent too much time in the bathroom, though. She tends to her antlers constantly over the day, mostly while sitting and watching TV during a break from her chores.
## Enhanced Senses
The [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarian]] sense of taste lets her experience food very intensely. Unfortunately, she does not like this at all, and therefore prefers bland low-fat food. Fortunately she's taking care of this herself and the rest of the family can still eat normally. On the other hand, she appreciates a good wine more than anything else.
# Personality
Mayra is a pretty strict stepmother. There are many things she cannot be bothered with, but she's pretty ruthless with the ones she does care about. She leaves almost no room for errors with these and uses physical punishment to enforce her will on the children.
She's especially concerned with the image she and her family has in their [[#Spiritual Beliefs|congregation]]. As the [[The Nethiel Church#Additional Responsibilities|Matron]] it is her duty to live by example, embody the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] values herself, as well as teach and bring them out in her [[#Family]].
## Flaws
She quickly gets angry, if the children make mistakes, especially on bad days. She tends to become rather unreasonable, if her charges don't fall in line. She is also pretty judgmental about things she doesn't fully understand, and tends to play them down with mocking humor.
She's vey tidy, and expects the children to be the same. She refuses to go to work, and rather makes up for it with stingyness.
## Strengths
She's very organized, responsible, and good at focusing on the most important problems first. She is also a very diligent housewife, minister, and pastor, and she's often making time for the people under her care. She's a good preacher and usually has an easy time to find the right words of encouragement.
She is generally very levelheaded, which can be refreshing at times and helps with staying in reality.
## Spiritual Beliefs
As a devout [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]], she strongly believes in and strives to live that faith. As the congregation's leader, she has a lot of duties and responsibilities, which she humbly devotes a large part of her time to.

#### Children
Jin's got 3 sisters and 2 brothers:
- [[Kyashi Naidesh I|Kyashi]] is the eldest sister, who's bound to a wheelchair. She's a rather quite women, but also likes to crack jokes about her disability. Jin loves to talk and spend time with her, and helps, even if she's perfectly capable of taking care of herself.
- [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]] is his next older sister, who likes to challenge and tease him. Toruco's a tough girl, who doesn't take shit from anyone. With the exception of their parents. Still, she's generally the rebellious one in the family.
- [[Forashi Naidesh|Forashi]] is the younger brother with which Jin enjoys a happy rivalry, be it training, games, or even chores. He's a very levelheaded person, who draws conclusions from his own thoughts, and loves to argue people into the ground.
- [[Tashi Naidesh I|Tashi]] the youngest is a kind girl who likes to act wild and tough, literally falling short by her appearance (she's not only the youngest but also the smallest). For Jin, she's pretty much the standard little sister to love and protect.
- **Mao**, his older brother, disappeared when [[#Mother|Raphaela]] died and circumstances forced the family to forget about him. At this time, its like he never even existed.

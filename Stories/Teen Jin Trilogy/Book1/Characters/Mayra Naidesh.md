# Physical
Generally, Mayra looks like a normal middle aged women. As a [[Mischlinge|hybrid]], her [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarian]] attributes are more dominant, though. Her whole body is rather **Dragnarian**, with the exception of her impressive [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] antlers, the blue **Nerivan** hair, and patterns on her skin. She wears her hair short in a pixie-like haircut.
## Apparel & Accessoires
Her everyday clothes are softly colored, often with floral patterns or imagery. She usually wears a buttoned blouse, simple cloth pants, and creamy colored Loafers. In [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]], she's wearing the minister's [[The Nethiel Church#More|black suit]], like all ministers do.
Small rectangular glasses sit on her nose, while she likes to wear colorful jewelry around her neck and wrists. On her left hand is a golden watch and her wedding ring.
## Hygiene
Mayra takes care to look somewhat presentable every day. She doesn't spent too much time in the bathroom, though. She tends to her antlers constantly over the day, mostly while sitting and watching TV during a break from her chores.
## Enhanced Senses
The [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarian]] sense of taste lets her experience food very intensely. Unfortunately, she does not like this at all, and therefore prefers bland low-fat food. Fortunately she's taking care of this herself and the rest of the family can still eat normally. On the other hand, she appreciates a good wine more than anything else.
# Personality
Mayra is a pretty strict stepmother. There are many things she cannot be bothered with, but she's pretty ruthless with the ones she does care about. She leaves almost no room for errors with these and uses physical punishment to enforce her will on the children.
She's especially concerned with the image she and her family has in their [[#Spiritual Beliefs|congregation]]. As the [[The Nethiel Church#Additional Responsibilities|Matron]] it is her duty to live by example, embody the [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]] values herself, as well as teach and bring them out in her [[#Family]].
## Flaws
She quickly gets angry, if the children make mistakes, especially on bad days. She tends to become rather unreasonable, if her charges don't fall in line. She is also pretty judgmental about things she doesn't fully understand, and tends to play them down with mocking humor.
She refuses to go to work, and rather makes up for it with stinginess.
## Strengths
She's very tidy, organized, responsible, and good at focusing on the most important problems first. She is also a very diligent housewife, minister, and pastor, and she's often making time for the people under her care. She's a good preacher and usually has an easy time to find the right words of encouragement.
She is generally very levelheaded, which can be refreshing at times and helps with staying in reality.
## Spiritual Beliefs
As a devout [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]], she strongly believes in and strives to live that faith. As the congregation's [[The Nethiel Church#Additional Responsibilities|Matron]], she has a lot of duties and responsibilities, which she humbly devotes a large part of her time to.

# Personal
Besides her duties as the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|congregation's Matron]], Mayra is a housewife. That means she spends her days doing chores like cleaning the appartement and shopping for groceries. She does regular breaks, of course, which she enjoys while watching some TV.
In the evenings she's often busy with her pastoral care. Next to the masses she has to prepare, organize, and hold, there are visits to church members, other ministers, or church organized workshops on a regular basis.
She doesn't want to get a job, because she believes her duties to the church would suffer, if she did. The family could use some extra money, but she makes up for the lack of it by being stingy. She's only buying the cheapest groceries, she drills the family not to waste electricity, heating, and water, and only agrees to go on vacation, if accommodations are free (e.g. offered by friends or distant family members). The children never join any class trips due to the costs, either, and they get very little pocket money.
## Habits
- On the rare occasion of a free evening, she likes to spent it with a glass of wine in front of the TV with her [[#Husband|husband]].
- She's used to cooking two meals, one for herself, which is low-fat-bland, and one for the rest of the family. She also cooks her own stuff, if [[#Husband|Debrann]] is cooking.
- She avoids sweet meals, candy or cake, like the plague for fear of gaining weight.
## Speech & Gestures
Mayra is a very good preacher. Her sermons are usually well structured, easy to follow, and interesting to listen to, with new insights into their [[#Spiritual Beliefs|faith]]. She's no enemy to humor either, but her general facial expressions are rather strict, anyway.
Outside of church, her speech becomes very colloquial and in anger, it can be humiliating.
# Social
In her position as the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|Matron]], she has the respect of all congregation members and is generally well connected. She regularly hangs out with or invites some women from church, to join her for a cup of coffee or to go shopping together.
## Family
Mayra married into the **Naidesh**-Family about half a year after [[Raphaela Naidesh]] died. She didn't have any children of her own, and was frankly overwhelmed by suddenly having 5 of them. As a stepmother she is pretty strict and often uses physical punishment, e.g. slaps in the face, to discipline her new charges.
### Members
At the moment, the **Naidesh**-Family consist of 7 members.
#### Husband
Not long after her own husband had died, she met [[Debrann Naidesh]] in her [[#Spiritual Beliefs|church]]. At first they just wanted to share in loosing a loved one, pray and grief together. However, they soon noticed their values and opinions also matched closely. It didn't take long for them to fall in love, and since **Debrann**'s children needed a mother, they quickly tied the knot in that regard.
Mayra appreciates him as a responsible and loyal husband, and is impressed and thankful for his unwavering faith, even if she sometimes has to reign him in with humorous remarks.
#### Children
With the husband came the children. Deep down, Mayra always wanted to be a mother, but it didn't work out with her previous husband (which was [[Die Forasier|Forasian]]), and she saw [[#Husband|Debrann]]'s appearance as a blessing from the [[The Nethiel Church#The Light|Light]] in this regard, too.
With 5 of them she was quickly overwhelmed, though, and she resorted to strict discipline to mold them to her will.
- [[Kyashi Naidesh I|Kyashi]] is the eldest, who's bound to a wheelchair. **Kyashi**'s already an [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Adult]], but Mayra still sees it as her responsibility to take care of her, even though she can actually do that herself pretty well.
- [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]] is his next younger girl, and she's a rebellious one. Mayra is especially strict and tough with her, because raising and disciplining her is harder than with the others.
- [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin]] is the older of the boys. He's generally a good boy, maybe a bit clumsy and distracted sometimes. Mayra's pretty fond of him, since he usually behaves well.
- [[Forashi Naidesh|Forashi]] is the younger boy and he's also rather hard to discipline, since he likes to argue and discuss a lot. She's rather strict with him, too, and often shuts him down before he even has time to open his mouth.
- [[Tashi Naidesh I|Tashi]] is the youngest girl and she's also generally well behaved. She likes to act tough, though, but Mayra is usually so busy with the other kids that most of **Tashi**'s shenanigans go by unnoticed.
### Family Residence
On Mayra's behest, the whole family moved from their nice house into her appartement near the city center. Mayra didn't want to give up her connections in this district and her responsibilities as the [[#Spiritual Beliefs|Matron]], and [[#Husband|Debrann]] reverently agreed. So instead of her moving into the big house, **Debrann** and the kids had to move into her smaller appartement.

#### Children
Jin's got 3 sisters and 2 brothers:
- [[Kyashi Naidesh I|Kyashi]] is the eldest sister, who's bound to a wheelchair. She's a rather quite women, but also likes to crack jokes about her disability. Jin loves to talk and spend time with her, and helps, even if she's perfectly capable of taking care of herself.
- [[Toruco Naidesh I|Toruco]] is his next older sister, who likes to challenge and tease him. Toruco's a tough girl, who doesn't take shit from anyone. With the exception of their parents. Still, she's generally the rebellious one in the family.
- [[Forashi Naidesh|Forashi]] is the younger brother with which Jin enjoys a happy rivalry, be it training, games, or even chores. He's a very levelheaded person, who draws conclusions from his own thoughts, and loves to argue people into the ground.
- [[Tashi Naidesh I|Tashi]] the youngest is a kind girl who likes to act wild and tough, literally falling short by her appearance (she's not only the youngest but also the smallest). For Jin, she's pretty much the standard little sister to love and protect.
- **Mao**, his older brother, disappeared when [[#Mother|Raphaela]] died and circumstances forced the family to forget about him. At this time, its like he never even existed.

# Physical
As a [[Die Titanier|Titanian]] she has the appearance of a fierce young humanoid wolf women. She likes to dress in loose pants, and either a loose jacket or tank tops, depending on the weather. She's also more fond of suits rather then dresses and wears a dark purple one to [[#Personality|church]]. Her fur is white, her skin dark, and her eyes pulse in an energetic violet color.
Her broad shouldered and well trained body, combined with her provocative and confident demeanor, radiates a fierce, almost feral, attitude.
# Personality
Toruco is a real free spirit that doesn't want to be restricted. She's also the tough one who doesn't take shit from anyone. That often puts her into trouble with authority and she tends to rebel against the rules a lot. That does'n sit well with her [[#Social|parents]], of course, who are the only ones with enough power to enforce their authority over her.
Although she still appears as an active [[The Nethiel Church|Nethiel]], her faith is already beyond doubting - its all bullshit to her and a means for parental oppression
# Personal
Physical activity is something she really likes, and she relishes in training with [[Aunt Nia]], both for the exercise and as a means to blow off all the bottled up anger from dealing with her [[#Social|parents]]. She does not feel at home with the family anymore and therefore tries to spend as much time as possible away from the appartement.
Unfortunately the parents expect her to also help with chores, and actively participate in church activities, which she does with heavy reluctance.
Toruco's voice is as fierce as her appearance and she can be quite vulgar. Her natural tone sounds pissed and accusatory.
# Social
If she's not out alone to get some distance, she actually likes to "hang" with [[Aunt Nia]]. **Nia** often doesn't mind to take her along to hunt or for extra training sessions, that is how Toruco became so strong. Additionally, and even though Toruco doesn't think much of [[#Personal|church]], she also likes to spend time with her best friend [[Wirbelwind Falkenfeder I|Wirbelwind]].
# Professional
Toruco visits the same school as [[Jin Naidesh I|Jin]] and [[Forashi Naidesh I|Forashi]], [[The Institute of Science#MID(dle) School|Enjar MID]] in [[Haarafir]]. She's not a model student at all and lacks in most subjects. Nonetheless she will graduate soon, by reaching [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|adulthood]].

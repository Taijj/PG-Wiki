# Kristallfeder

After THE_CALMITY the people of Lygea were forced into rather secluded existences. Many had perished and the few survivors took some time until some dared to venture out into the wilds, again. While some only waited a few decades, most waited for generations, and a few even preferred to never open up to the world again.

It was the nature of the Dragnarians again to open up to the rest of the world, and they began to explore what became of it, anew. Living under the sea, they weren't interested in claiming more land for themselves, but rather re-discover and rebuild relationships with the other races, to restore multi-beneficial trade.

However, fear from everything "outside" was a widespread mindset of most survivors, which turned into open hostility against anything different. That was the main reason that impeded the races of Lygea to intermingle. However, the Dragnarians resolve was strong, and it could not be stopped, of course.

Dragnarian ships picked up representatives, adventurers, and refugees from all continents on their journeys. Those, in time, started to claim land for themselves all over Lygea. As time went on, more and more people started to reclaim the territories lost to the demons. When they discovered the small hybrid societies, a lot of them were destroyed by the right of birth the original inhabitants often claimed.

  

Kristallfeder was a second generation hybrid girl. Her Father, a Nerivan-Teyan hybrid, and her mother, a pure blood Rowagian, perished during a raid of the new Rowagian Kingdom, which left the girl orphaned. She, and others, got lucky and found refuge on a Dragnarian Trade ship, which happened to anchor at her village at that time. While their savior was keen on getting rid of them all, Kristallfeder got him to take her on, as a permanent crew member at least. So Kristallfeder became a sailor with the goal to explore the world, and in hope of finding a place where hybrids like her, could start a civilization in peace.

  

Kristallfeder spent most of her teen years in the service of different Dragnarian captains, gathering experience, exploring Lygea - always on the lookout for tales, rumors, or even legends that might help her to reach her goal. She combined that with all the knowledge she had access to due to her friendship to the Dragnarians. Their generations lasted the longest, and also had the largest archives of knowledge saved from the old world, which she eagerly studied.

She learned that basically every continent could - and she expected would - be claimed by any of the other races at some point, except Sciena. The Evelites had vacated their continent, which was exactly what she was looking for.

She still spent a few years on the sea, gathering resources, skills, and maybe friends she could recruit to her cause. She explored the coastline of their soon to be home, evaluating and scouting out the dangers ahead, before finally stepping foot on it.

# Flesh and Fairy Dust (Terraria)

With her friends she set out on an expedition, an expedition to claim land for themselves.

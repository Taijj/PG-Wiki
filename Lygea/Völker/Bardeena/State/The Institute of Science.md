	German:Institut der Wissenschaft

The responsibilities of the institute lie in the gain, extension, and teaching of knowledge. It is there, to advance the sciences, to make new discoveries and to keep the population educated.
# Department of Research
This is the department responsible for the gain and extension of knowledge in all sciences.
## Sections
The department organizes itself in so-called "Sections". A specific **Section** is concerned with a respective field of science, and usually corresponds to a single location as well, e.g. a building or town.
### Section I
	Fields: History, Mathematics, Planetology
Section I was established not long after [[The founding of Bardeena|Bardeena was founded]]. Not much had to be done, however, since that was the spot where the settlers had built their first camp anyway. In the end it just came down to a name change from Anbar(teyan: Place of Appearance) to Section I, after the institute made plans on how to proceed with their researching.
This section was the main research center for most of the sciences, since it was established inside the old ruins of an [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Dome]], the ruins of **Cardis**, their capital, in fact. Over time some subjects were extracted into the other sections when more fitting places were discovered.

Nowadays Section I mainly deals with research in the following fields:
- **History** - The [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] left behind a vast digital library, containing most of their knowledge. Decryption and deciphering of that knowledge is not easy, though, and keeps a team of scientists very busy. Also, because they try to use it to add their own records to it, too.
- **Mathematics** - The previously mentioned library makes it also rather easy to learn and adapt the **Evelitian** findings in the fields of **Mathematics**, **Logic**, and **System Theory**.
- **Planetology** - The science of the planets, Lygea herself as well as the other celestial bodies, is not only supported by the **Evelitian** library, but also by the large observatory built into the city center. It survived [[The Calamity]] with rather minimal damage, and Bardeenian scientist were able to basically restore it, after some years. Planetology here encompasses fields like **Geology**, **Oceanography**, **Meteorology**, **Climatology**, as well as all of the previous ones in an **Astronomy** context.
## Section II 
	Fields: Physics & Material Science
Some time after they've defeated the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Mencarni Collective|Mencarni Collective]] for good, [[Kristallfeder Enjar|Kristallfeder]] and her friends discovered the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Screaming Forest|Screaming Forest]] and defeated its ruler, **Animix**. They found another one of the [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Domes]] hidden by the forest, uncovering the ruins and the vast mining network of the ancient city of **Michanipolis**.
After it was secured and the scientists moved in, it became known as Section II. Research here is mainly done in the fields of **Physics** and **Material Science**. They basically try to recover, adapt, and possibly continue the work of their **Evelitian** predecessors. Most technological advances are credited to this section.
### Section III
	Field: Chemistry
Research concerning [[Die Elemente|The Elements]], how they work, how they interact, and how they can be combined is done here. Section III is a large and vast **Chemistry** lab, that was build right after the victory over the [[The founding of Bardeena#Flesh and Fairy Dust|Forasian Invaders]].
Initially, it was part of [[#Section I]], but was moved along with the exploration and fortification of the continent until they reached [[Bavista]]. There it stayed to this day, since its research is very beneficial for military operations.
### Section IV
	Field: Anomiology
Section IV is concerned with **Anomiology**, which is the lygean science of the [[Die Anomi|Anomi]]. It includes fields like **Zoology**([[Die Tiere|Animals]]) and **Herbology**([[Die Pflanzen|Plants]]), as well as **Demonology**([[Die Dämonen|Demons]], and **Mythiology**. The latter developed, since occurrences of pure [[Die Mythen|Myths]], [[Die Partikulare|Particulars]], and [[Die Elementare|Elementals]] became rather rare after the [[The Calamity|Calamity]], and developing modern science rather treats them as one as the same ("mystical monsters").
Section IV is a large Farm situated near [[Nasbel]], where breeding and growing is easy, and research can be done unperturbed.
### Section V
	Field: Evetology
As the country's years grew, and [[Haarafir]]'s fortifications and city walls neared completion, the first signs of more **Evelitian** ruins were detected in and around the [[Marros]]. This sparked a renewed interest in the **Evelitian** heritage and their culture.
A group of scientists specifically interested in those fields, extracted what they could from the library of [[#Section I]], and moved their base of operations to **Haarafir**. There they built a museum, which over the coming years developed into the center for a field they named **Evetology**.
With a main focus on the **Evelitian** legacy, Section V also became the center for general **Anthropology**, **Archeology**, and **language** research.
### Section VI
	Fields: Mysticism & The Soul
Another section that extracted itself from [[#Section I]]'s vast amount of ancient knowledge to find a more fitting place to breathe freely, literally in this case. The study of the [[Die Seele|Soul]], which naturally deals a lot with the [[Die Emotionen|emotional]] side of life, became rather one-sided inside the dark and rather confining spaces of the old **Evelitian** capital.
So the moved their work near another ancient ruin. One from the [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarians]] this time. The ruins of **Fodivitas** are located close to [[Nasbel]]. And, though a bunch of **Evelitian** artifacts could also be recovered there, the city was clearly **Dragnarian** origin in layout and design. There, the studies of the Soul actually start in ernest.
Section VI became a kind of spiritual Oasis, where the **Soul**, **Emotions** and by extension the field of [[Die Mystik|Mysticism]] is studied and practiced in many ways. Later on it also became a place of knowledge about the phenomenon of [[Körperlose Seelen|disembodied souls]], and how to best deal with them.
### Section VII
	Field: Medicine
This section shares its history with [[#Section III]], and split off of it after some years. The alchemists and potion-makers supporting the [[The founding of Bardeena#Flesh and Fairy Dust|battles of old]] were preceded by a capable group of doctors and researchers in the field of **Medicine**, who built their own section in another district in the city of [[Bavista]].
The Section VII Hospital is the largest, best equipped and most specialized healing facility of the country. Besides treating patients, they study bacterial and viral diseases, genetics, and they develop potent modern Pharmaceuticals.
### Section VIII
	Field: Invis Biology
It took a while, until the new country calmed down enough to be able to shift the focus to themselves and their own bodies. Interest in the topic of **Invis Biology** steadily grew in the city of [[Haarafir]], since it was at peace the longest, after the country was founded. Also, the primarily [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] nature of the population was especially interesting to explore.
Initially composed of private researchers, a number of them finally decided at some point to share their findings and combine their efforts in the field. An effort that was rewarded with the establishment of Section VIII, which nowadays not only deals with **Biology**, but also topics like **Neuroscience**.
### Section IX
Haarafir - Computer & Data (Information, Statistics, Cybersecurity, AI) - 9
### Section X
Nasbel - Ecology (Environment) - 10
### Section XI
Fodivitas - Psychology (Sociology, Economics, Learning) - 11
### Section XII
Fodivitas - Phylosophy
# Section XIII
## Secrecy
The oldest and largest of them are heavily guarded and mostly house [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]] as well as scientific personnel. The largest and most important ones were established in the ruins of old evelitian domes. Those house the very valuable tech left behind by the fleeing Evelitians, and are the most important edge Bardeena has against its enemies.

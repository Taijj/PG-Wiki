	German:Institut der Wissenschaft

The responsibilities of the institute lie in the gain, extension, and teaching of knowledge. It is there, to advance the sciences, to make new discoveries and to keep the population educated.
# Department of Research
This is the department responsible for the gain and extension of knowledge in all sciences.
## Sections
The department organizes itself in so-called "Sections". A specific **Section** is concerned with a respective field of science, and usually corresponds to a single location as well, e.g. a building or town.
### Section I
	Fields: History, Mathematics, Planetology
Section I was established not long after [[The founding of Bardeena|Bardeena was founded]]. Not much had to be done, however, since that was the spot where the settlers had built their first camp anyway. In the end it just came down to a name change from Anbar(teyan: Place of Appearance) to Section I, after the institute made plans on how to proceed with their researching.
This section was the main research center for most of the sciences, since it was established inside the old ruins of an [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Dome]], the ruins of **Cardis**, their capital, in fact. Over time some subjects were extracted into the other sections when more fitting places were discovered.

Nowadays Section I mainly deals with research in the following fields:
- **History** - The [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] left behind a vast digital library, containing most of their knowledge. Decryption and deciphering of that knowledge is not easy, though, and keeps a team of scientists very busy. Also, because they try to use it to add their own records to it, too.
- **Mathematics** - The previously mentioned library makes it also rather easy to learn and adapt the **Evelitian** findings in the fields of **Mathematics**, **Logic**, and **System Theory**.
- **Planetology** - The science of the planets, Lygea herself as well as the other celestial bodies, is not only supported by the **Evelitian** library, but also by the large observatory built into the city center. It survived [[The Calamity]] with rather minimal damage, and Bardeenian scientist were able to basically restore it, after some years. Planetology here encompasses fields like **Geology**, **Oceanography**, **Meteorology**, **Climatology**, as well as all of the previous ones in an **Astronomy** context.
### Section II 
	Fields: Physics, Material Science, Space
Some time after they've defeated the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Mencarni Collective|Mencarni Collective]] for good, [[Kristallfeder Enjar|Kristallfeder]] and her friends discovered the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Screaming Forest|Screaming Forest]] and defeated its ruler, **Animix**. They found another one of the [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Domes]] hidden by the forest, uncovering the ruins and the vast mining network of the ancient city of **Michanipolis**.
After it was secured and the scientists moved in, it became known as Section II. Researchers basically try to recover, adapt, and possibly continue the work of their **Evelitian** predecessors here. Most large technological advances are credited to this section.

What the [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] left behind here, is most advantageous for these fields:
- **Material Science** - the vast network of mineshafts under and around **Michanipolis** gave the [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] access to vast amounts of natural resources. Though, the [[The Calamity|Calamity]] caused a widespread collapse, it also unveiled a lot of precious metals, minerals, and gemstones they had still left behind. Restoring the mining network is a good opportunity to tap into those.
- **Physics** - Left behind were also a number of large and complex machines to reverse engineer. They give inspiration and help with research in the physical fields, e.g. Mechanics, Thermodynamics, and Electricity.
- **Space** - A large chunk of **Evelitian** space research was also found here, which sparked the creation of a space program. This one's still pretty young, though. But they did manage to bring a rather simple communications satellite into orbit.
### Section III
	Field: Chemistry
Research concerning [[Die Elemente|The Elements]], how they work, how they interact, and how they can be combined is done here. Section III is a large and vast **Chemistry** lab, that was build right after the victory over the [[The founding of Bardeena#Flesh and Fairy Dust|Forasian Invaders]].
Initially, it was part of [[#Section I]], but was moved along with the exploration and fortification of the continent until they reached [[Bavista]]. There it stayed to this day, since its research is very beneficial for military operations.
### Section IV
	Field: Anomiology
Section IV is concerned with **Anomiology**, which is the lygean science of the [[Die Anomi|Anomi]]. It includes fields like **Zoology**([[Die Tiere|Animals]]) and **Herbology**([[Die Pflanzen|Plants]]), as well as **Demonology**([[Die Dämonen|Demons]], and **Mythiology**. The latter developed, since occurrences of pure [[Die Mythen|Myths]], [[Die Partikulare|Particulars]], and [[Die Elementare|Elementals]] became rather rare after the [[The Calamity|Calamity]], and developing modern science rather treats them as one as the same ("mystical monsters").
Section IV is a large Farm situated near [[Nasbel]], where breeding and growing is easy, and research can be done unperturbed.
### Section V
	Field: Evetology
As the country's years grew, and [[Haarafir]]'s fortifications and city walls neared completion, the first signs of more **Evelitian** ruins were detected in and around the [[Marros]]. This sparked a renewed interest in the **Evelitian** heritage and their culture.
A group of scientists specifically interested in those fields, extracted what they could from the library of [[#Section I]], and moved their base of operations to **Haarafir**. There they built a museum, which over the coming years developed into the center for a field they named **Evetology**.
With a main focus on the **Evelitian** legacy, Section V also became the center for general **Anthropology**, **Archeology**, and **language** research.
### Section VI
	Fields: Mysticism & The Soul
Another section that extracted itself from [[#Section I]]'s vast amount of ancient knowledge to find a more fitting place to breathe freely, literally in this case. The study of the [[Die Seele|Soul]], which naturally deals a lot with the [[Die Emotionen|emotional]] side of life, became rather one-sided inside the dark and rather confining spaces of the old **Evelitian** capital.
So the moved their work near another ancient ruin. One from the [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarians]] this time. The ruins of **Fodivitas** are located close to [[Nasbel]]. And, though a bunch of **Evelitian** artifacts could also be recovered there, the city was clearly **Dragnarian** origin in layout and design. There, the studies of the Soul actually start in ernest.
Section VI became a kind of spiritual Oasis, where the **Soul**, **Emotions** and by extension the field of [[Die Mystik|Mysticism]] is studied and practiced in many ways. Later on it also became a place of knowledge about the phenomenon of [[Körperlose Seelen|disembodied souls]], and how to best deal with them.
### Section VII
	Field: Medicine
This section shares its history with [[#Section III]], and split off of it after some years. The alchemists and potion-makers supporting the [[The founding of Bardeena#Flesh and Fairy Dust|battles of old]] were preceded by a capable group of doctors and researchers in the field of **Medicine**, who built their own section in another district in the city of [[Bavista]].
The Section VII Hospital is the largest, best equipped and most specialized healing facility of the country. Besides treating patients, they study bacterial and viral diseases, genetics, and they develop potent modern Pharmaceuticals.
### Section VIII
	Field: Invis Biology
It took a while, until the new country calmed down enough to be able to shift the focus to themselves and their own bodies. Interest in the topic of **Invis Biology** steadily grew in the city of [[Haarafir]], since it was at peace the longest, after the country was founded. Also, the primarily [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] nature of the population was especially interesting to explore.
Initially composed of private researchers, a number of them finally decided at some point to share their findings and combine their efforts in the field. An effort that was rewarded with the establishment of Section VIII, which nowadays not only deals with **Biology**, but also with topics like **Neuroscience**.
### Section IX
	Fields: Information & Data Science
This section was moved around the most. It started out as a part of [[#Section I]], but was then moved to [[Haarafir]], then [[#Section II]], and back to **Haarafir**, after [[#Section II]]'s satellite began operations. During that time, computers became high in demand pretty much all over the country, but especially for the [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]], of course.
It was considered to also move it to [[Bavista]], but then they basically invented the internet, which was extended over the entire country, by an upgraded satellite. This way, the section's physical location stopped mattering.
Now, the latest in computer software and hardware is researched here, also information in general, statistics, cyber security, and AI of course.
### Section X
	Field: Ecology
From the beginning, they knew they would have to be careful with the little land they claimed for themselves. They had to use the space and resources they have efficiently and without endangering their future. All Sections tried to do this anyway, but with time it became more complicated.
They thought it best to turn this need into its own section and scientists from other sections, primarily [[#Section I|I]], [[#Section III|III]] and [[#Section IV|IV]] joined together. The 10th section was born, which deals with matters of **Ecology** and the **Environment**.
### Section XI
	Fields: Psychology, Sociology, Learning
After many years, [[#Section VI]] grew a bit too large and it was decided to split it into two. They both still reside near the ruins of **Fodivitas**, [[Nasbel]]. **Section VI**, had grown into a temple-like structure, while this turned into out as a rather modern office building - a very cozy one, though.
### Section XII
	Field: Secret
The youngest and smallest section was created after the ruins of **Antholopos** where discovered inside the [[Marros]]. During construction of the [[Haarafir#The Ener-Gea|Ener-Gea]], the workers stumbled upon one of many large tunnels that seemingly went through the entire mountain.
When they discovered the [[The Capsule Kids|Capsule Kids]] in a similar tunnel, they established the **Secret Section XII** to study the 6 children. Nobody found out what they were, nor how they got there. The children themselves also didn't give any clues. They seemed to be just normal babies.
So their efforts focused more on waking all of them up, observing their growth, and integrating them into their society.
## Secrecy
The oldest and largest of the Sections are heavily guarded and house [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]] as well as scientific personnel. They house very valuable knowledge and tech - left behind by the [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] or newly developed - and are the most important edge Bardeena has against its enemies.
That is why unauthorized access to any of the sections is prevented from anyone without clearance, civilian or otherwise.
# Department of Innovation
While the [[#Department of Research]] is concerned with gathering knowledge, this one tries to find ways to use it. Experimentation, invention, evaluation and testing of how the discovered things can best be used to benefit the entire country is done extensively here.
## Secrecy
This department is held to the same degree of secrecy, concerning new knowledge and technologies, as the research department is. This is to keep their technological edge over the world as well as to protect it.
A thing they've learned, e.g. when they first discovered **Evelitian** weapons, was that they had to use caution with new discoveries. A powerful idea or thing handled carelessly could end up doing more harm to themselves than good. That is why their own general public is also kept in the dark about new discoveries at first.
## Process
In order to prevent misuse and potential resulting catastrophes, they established a process of evaluation for each idea sparked from new knowledge. Evaluation is done in teams, often set against each other, until the most promising ideas emerge.
### Ideas
For most ideas, this process is over rather quickly. Either because the given idea leads to nothing, or it is small and has a pretty obvious low impact on society as it is. Still, caution dictates to give any idea a certain amount of time to brew. All ideas, without exception, have to go through that process, more or less strict.
### Experimentation & Invention
First they experiment with any new piece of knowledge, and try to find ways of how it could be incorporated into everyday life. They run experiments, build gadgets, combine it with existing things, until they come up with one or multiple viable use cases. Research scientists are consulted regularly.
### Testing & Iteration
The emerging use cases are refined and iterated over a few times. Not just to make the new discovery as useful as possible, but also to find ways to break and misuse it. This way they hope to identify the most unknown unknowns, and turn the new technology into something that is useful and safe.
### Observation & Adjusting
After the testing phase, the new tech, process, or information is handed over to a selected few teams or individuals of other departments (e.g. the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Department of Police|Police]], or the [[The Board of Requirements#Department of Production|Departmetn of Production]]). 
Members of this department will then keep an eye on how it is used. Often, more refinement and testing is necessary until a final evaluation is reached.
### Release
In the end, if the idea passed all tests and concerns, it will be released to the public, i.e. released for mass production or incorporated into the country's common knowledge. Then it benefits every citizen. After a few years of public access, it may even be traded to foreign parties.
## Location
A number of smaller **Innovation Facilities** are spread all over the country's settlements, usually in close proximity to one of the research [[#Sections]]. These facilities are usually protected by a few [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]] officers, depending on their importance.

**A.T.O.M**
Large impact ideas on the other hand often need a widespread area of land (especially weapons).
For that purpose, the **A.T.O.M** testing facility was created, which stands for "Advanced Testing and Observation Mission". It is located on the large peninsula East of [[Bavista]], and is the place where the most dangerous substances and most powerful weapons are tested.
# Department of Education
The Bardeenian system of education, in its entirety, is handled by this department. Most of the schools are publicly funded, but there is one or the other private one as well. However, all schools have to adhere to certain standards, before introducing their individual twists and processes.
## Diversity
Not only is the nation's population mostly made up of [[Mischlinge|Hybrids]], but all the remaining pure blood citizens are also a mixture of races, cultures, and different ages of maturity. This put the Bardeenian schools in front of a multitude of hard challenges, they had to overcome over many years.
Diversity is one of Bardeena's [[Bardeena#Culture|core values]], and heavily encouraged. The schooling system not only accounts for that, but embraces it fully and tries to foster it as a blessing in all pupils. Individual learning, progression, and graduation is the result. Individual [[#Classes|subject classes]], interdisciplinary projects, or competitions between different schools are the means. Diversity in culture, age, and skill level is [[#Appreciation Festival|celebrated]], too.
## Classes
Classes, in the classical sense of a class-year, don't exist in this system. Each individual subject is divided into multiple classes (Math I, Language IV, Chemistry III, etc.). Each class represents a certain skill level of a subject. So, each individual pupil is actually in several classes at once, depending on their respective skills in the the given subject.
So classes are made up of differently aged pupils with roughly the same skill, but different age and level of maturity. If a pupil acquires the required knowledge and skills to advance to the next class, they may choose to do so soon. They might also stay on for a while longer, to either practice some more, or help with tutoring their fellow pupil (see: [[#Grading & Graduation]]).
This has an impact on pupil timetables of course, which may undergo a lot of changes over the course of a year. It also gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships with fellow classmates, at times. To compensate, and to give pupils a break of course, every school day has an hour of mid-day recess. Additionally, pupils are encouraged to join extracurricular activities, like study clubs, or just stay in school to doo homework together. However, this is optional.
## School Levels
Schools organize themselves into different levels as well, which go from the most basic knowledge to more and more specialized subjects. Some schools only teach at one level, while others expand to a whole campus, teaching at multiple levels.
### Daycare & Kindergarten
These are actually handled by the [[The Ministry of Community#Department of Family|Department of Family]], but also work closely together with this department to prepare the children for what's to come. The teaching happening here is less structured and more concerned with early childhood development then to actual subject matter, too.
### Fun(damental) School
	German: Grundschule
Here pupils learn the absolute basics of the basics of the common knowledge expected in every Bardeenian citizen. All pupils absolutely have to learn everything this level can teach in order for society to deem them capable of contributing.

Subjects:
- **Math & Science** - Basic algebra and geometry, simple physics and chemistry
- **Language & Literature** - Reading, Writing, Speaking, using language
- **History & Home** - Basic local history, handling money, the state organization, housework
- **Sports & Wilderness** - Sports & Health, basic navigation, local Flora & Fauna, basic Anomiology
- **Arts, Crafts & Music** - Drawing, Painting, Sculpting, Pottery, Singing, Notation, Playing an Instrument
- **Culture & Diversity** - Overview over all the [[Die Invis|Invis]] cultures and religions, rituals, [[Die Mystik|mystic]] pitfalls

Most children graduate as [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Interactors]], while cases of earlier and later levels is considered normal, too - everyone learns at their own pace. Graduation ceremonies are held every quarter of a year, and graduates receive a so-called **Fundamentals Diploma**.
This diploma theoretically enables them to start a career - an admittedly simple one, but a career nonetheless. Children have to continue with school until they are **Adults**, so this does not happen often. **Adult** graduates do happen once in a blue moon, though. Especially amongst pure-blood [[Die Forasier|Forasians]], but even for them continuation is still the norm.
### Mid(dle) School
	German: Mittelschule
In middle school, subjects build on top of the basic knowledge each pupil acquired from the previous level. The total number of subjects increased significantly and pupils therefore have to choose, which they want to learn.

Subjects:
Subjects are divided into categories and pupils have to select at least one subject of each going forward. If they wish, they may also choose more subjects from any given category, as long as there's still capacity on their time table.
The following lists all the categories with example subjects for each. Not all subjects are available at all the schools, though, and some build on the knowledge of others and can only be chosen as soon as the required knowledge was acquired:
- **Logical**: Math, Informatics, Statistics, Data Science
- **Language**: Second, Third, Fourth, etc.
- **Natural**: Physics, Biology, Chemistry, [[#Section I|Planetology]], [[#Section IV|Anomiology]]
- **Artistic**: Visual Arts, Performing Arts
- **Cultural**: General or race specific History, [[#Section V|Evetology]]
- **Physical**: Athletics, Gymnastics, Dance, Martial Arts
- **Mystic**:
	- [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Animation|Animations]] - usually in combination with Martial Arts
	- Enchantments - mostly dealing with [[Die Mystik#Mystifizierungen|Mystifications]] of places and objects
	- Gemology - in this case in regard to their mystic capabilities
	- Curses - about [[Geister|ghosts]] and the [[Besessene|posessed]]

Graduation ceremonies are held every quarter of a year here as well. Graduates receive the so-called **Mid Diploma**, which lists all their chosen subjects and how many [[#Classes]] they've completed for each. Pupils become eligible for graduation, when either of the following happens:
- They completed all classes for each chosen mandatory subject, or
- They became an adult

Adults may choose to finish, but as soon as a subject is failed, it is locked in


Mid School - Builds on basic knowledge (Certain skills are required to progress in certain subjects), gets a tad more specialized, more student choice


Advanced School - Further expands specialized knowledge with complete student choice of subjects

From here on, not home town/vilage anymore

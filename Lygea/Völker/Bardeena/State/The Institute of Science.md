	German:Institut der Wissenschaft

The responsibilities of the institute lie in the gain, extension, and teaching of knowledge. It is there, to advance the sciences, to make new discoveries and to keep the population educated.
# Department of Research
This is the department responsible for the gain and extension of knowledge in all sciences.
## Sections
The department organizes itself in so-called "Sections". A specific **Section** is concerned with a respective field of science, and usually corresponds to a single location as well, e.g. a building or town.
### Section I
Section I was established not long after [[The founding of Bardeena|Bardeena was founded]]. Not much had to be done, however, since that was the spot where the settlers had built their first camp anyway. In the end it just came down to a name change from Anbar(teyan: Place of Appearance) to Section I, after the institute made plans on how to proceed with their researching.
This section was the main research center for most of the sciences, since it was established inside the old ruins of an [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Dome]], the ruins of **Cardis**, their capital, in fact. Over time some subjects were extracted into the other sections when more fitting places were discovered.

Nowadays Section I mainly deals with research in the following fields:
- **History** - The [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] left behind a vast digital library, containing most of their knowledge. Decryption and deciphering of that knowledge is not easy, though, and keeps a team of scientists very busy. Also, because they try to use it to add their own records to it, too.
- **Mathematics** - The previously mentioned library makes it also rather easy to learn and adapt the **Evelitian** findings in the fields of **Mathematics**, **Logic**, and **System Theory**.
- **Planetology** - The science of the planets, Lygea herself as well as the other celestial bodies, is not only supported by the **Evelitian** library, but also by the large observatory built into the city center. It survived [[The Calamity]] with rather minimal damage, and Bardeenian scientist were able to basically restore it, after some years. Planetology here encompasses fields like **Geology**, **Oceanography**, **Meteorology**, **Climatology**, as well as all of the previous ones in an **Astronomy** context.
## Section II 
Some time after they've defeated the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Mencarni Collective|Mencarni Collective]] for good, [[Kristallfeder Enjar|Kristallfeder]] and her friends discovered the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Screaming Forest|Screaming Forest]] and defeated its ruler, **Animix**. They found another one of the [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Domes]] hidden by the forest, uncovering the ruins and the vast mining network of **Michanipolis** that way.
After it was secured and the scientists moved in, it became known as Section II. Research here is mainly done in the fields of **Physics** and **Material Science**. They basically try to recover, adapt, and possibly continue the work of their **Evelitian** predecessors.
### Section III

Elemental Chemistry, from Cardis to Bavista
### Section IV
Nasbel - Anomiology (Botany, Zoology, Mythology)
### Section V
Haarafir - Antrhropology (Archeology, Evelites, Language)
### Section VI
Fodivitas - Soul (Mysticism, Emotions, Ghosts, Possessed)
### Section VII
Bavista - Medicine (Bacteria, Viruses, Genetics, Pharmacology)
### Section VIII
Haarafir - Biology (Invis, Hybrids, Neuroscience)
### Section IX
Bavista - Computer & Data (Information, Statistics, Cybersecurity, AI) - 9
### Section X
Nasbel - Ecology (Environment) - 10
### Section XI
Fodivitas - Psychology (Sociology, Economics, Learning) - 11
### Section XII
Fodivitas - Phylosophy
## Secrecy
The oldest and largest of them are heavily guarded and mostly house [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]] as well as scientific personnel. The largest and most important ones were established in the ruins of old evelitian domes. Those house the very valuable tech left behind by the fleeing Evelitians, and are the most important edge Bardeena has against its enemies.

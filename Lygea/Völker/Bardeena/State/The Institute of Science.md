	German: Institut der Wissenschaft

The responsibilities of the institute lie in the gain, extension, and teaching of knowledge. It is there, to advance the sciences, to make new discoveries, and to keep the population educated.
# Department of Research
This is the department responsible for the gain and extension of knowledge in all sciences.
## Sections
The department organizes itself in so-called **Sections**. A specific **Section** is concerned with a respective field of science and usually corresponds to a single location as well, e.g. a building or a whole town.
### Section I
	Fields: History, Mathematics, Planetology
**Section I** was established not long after [[The founding of Bardeena|Bardeena was founded]]. Not much had to be done, however, since that was the spot where the settlers had built their first camp anyway. In the end it just came down to a name change from **Anbar** (teyan: Place of Appearance) to **Section I**, after the institute made plans on how to proceed with their researching.
This section was the main research center for most of the sciences, since it was established inside the old ruins of an [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Dome]], the ruins of **Cardis** in fact, their capital. Over time some subjects were extracted into the other sections when more fitting places were discovered.

Nowadays **Section I** mainly deals with research in the following fields:
- **History** - The [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] left behind a vast digital library, containing most of their knowledge. Decryption and deciphering of that knowledge is not easy, though, and keeps a team of scientists very busy. Also because they try to add their own records, too.
- **Mathematics** - The previously mentioned library makes it also rather easy to learn and adapt the **Evelitian** findings in the fields of **Mathematics**, **Logic**, and **System Theory**.
- **Planetology** - The science of the planets, Lygea herself, as well as the other celestial bodies is not only supported by the **Evelitian** library, but also by the large observatory built into the city center. It survived the [[The Calamity|Calamity]] with rather minimal damage and Bardeenian scientist were able to basically restore it after some years. Planetology here encompasses fields like **Geology**, **Oceanography**, **Meteorology**, **Climatology**, as well as all of the previous ones in an **Astronomy** context.
### Section II 
	Fields: Physics, Material Science, Space
Some time after they've defeated the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Mencarni Collective|Mencarni Collective]] for good, [[Kristallfeder Enjar|Kristallfeder]] and her friends discovered the [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors#The Screaming Forest|Screaming Forest]] and defeated its ruler, **Animix**. They found another one of the [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Domes]] hidden by the forest, uncovering the ruins themselves and the vast mining network of the ancient city of **Michanipolis**.
After it was secured, and the scientists moved in, it became known as **Section II**. Researchers basically try to recover, adapt, and possibly continue the work of their **Evelitian** predecessors here. Most large technological advances are credited to this section.

What the [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] left behind here is most advantageous for these fields:
- **Material Science** - The vast network of mineshafts under and around **Michanipolis** gave the [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] access to vast amounts of natural resources. Though the [[The Calamity|Calamity]] caused a widespread collapse, it also unveiled a lot of precious metals, minerals, and gemstones they had still left behind. Restoring the mining network is a good opportunity to tap into these.
- **Physics** - Left behind were also a number of large and complex machines to reverse engineer. They give inspiration and help with research in the physical fields, e.g. Mechanics, Thermodynamics, and Electricity.
- **Space** - A large chunk of **Evelitian** space research was also found here, which sparked the creation of a space program. This one's still pretty young, though. But they did manage to bring a rather simple communications satellite into orbit.
### Section III
	Field: Chemistry
Research concerning the [[Die Elemente|Elements]], how they work, how they interact, and how they can be combined is done here. **Section III** is a large and vast **Chemistry** lab that was build right after the victory over the [[The founding of Bardeena#Flesh and Fairy Dust|Forasian Invaders]].
Initially, it was part of [[#Section I]], but was moved along with the exploration and fortification of the continent until they reached [[Bavista]]. There it stayed to this day, since its research is very beneficial for military operations.
### Section IV
	Field: Anomiology
**Section IV** is concerned with **Anomiology**, which is the lygean science of the [[Die Anomi|Anomi]]. It includes fields like **Zoology**([[Die Tiere|Animals]]), **Herbology**([[Die Pflanzen|Plants]]), **Demonology**([[Die Dämonen|Demons]]), and **Mythiology**. The latter developed, since occurrences of pure [[Die Mythen|Myths]], [[Die Partikulare|Particulars]], and [[Die Elementare|Elementals]] became rather rare after the [[The Calamity|Calamity]], and the emerging modern science rather treats them as one as the same ("mystical monsters").
**Section IV** is a large farm situated near [[Nasbel]] where breeding and growing is easy, and research can be done unperturbed.
### Section V
	Field: Evetology
As the country's years grew, and [[Haarafir]]'s fortifications and city walls neared completion, the first signs of more **Evelitian** ruins were detected in and around the [[Marros]]. This sparked a renewed interest in the **Evelitian** heritage and their culture.
A group of scientists specifically interested in those fields extracted what they could from the library of [[#Section I]] and moved their base of operations to **Haarafir**. There they built a museum, which developed into the center for a field they named **Evetology** over the coming years.
With a main focus on the **Evelitian** legacy **Section V** also became the center for general **Anthropology**, **Archeology**, and **Language** research.
### Section VI
	Fields: Mysticism & Spirituality
Another section that extracted itself from [[#Section I]]'s vast amount of ancient knowledge, to find a more fitting place. In this case it was due to an encounter with an ancient spirit inside the ruins of the old [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarian]] city of **Fodivitas**. To study the spirit, to communicate and learn from it, this section was established.
The spirit, who appears as a raceless female figure, has fallen victim to the degradation of time, but remains enough of herself to stay peaceful. Her memory has suffered greatly, though. Still, she agreed to become a part of **Section VI** and help out as much as she can. In exchange the researches promised to help her remember and fulfill her unfinished business. Since she cannot remember her name, they gave her the name **MARIA**.
With **MARIA**'s help, **Section VI** became a place of knowledge about the phenomenon of [[Körperlose Seelen|disembodied souls]] and how to best deal with them. Over time it developed into a kind of spiritual oasis where the [[Die Seele|Soul]], [[Die Emotionen|Emotions]], and the field of [[Die Mystik|Mysticism]] is studied and practiced in many ways.

>[!note]+ Notes
>- **MARIA** is the spirit of an [[Die Eveliten|Evelitian]] eldest, killed during [[The Calamity]].
>- **MARIA**'s name and appearance is inspired by characters of the game *Final Fantasy VI*, especially *Terra in Esper form*, and *Maria* from the opera scene.
>- Most of the Bardeenian knowledge was built and derived from the findings of the [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]]. By modern standards those teachings have the notion of actual myth. That is why a lot of true knowledge about the [[Die Seele|Soul]] and its role in the world got lost to obscurity or was passed off as the stuff of fairy tales. Commonly **Mysticism** is therefore attributed to the work of an individual's brain instead.
### Section VII
	Field: Medicine
This section shares its history with [[#Section III]] and split off of it after some years. The alchemists and potion-makers supporting the [[The founding of Bardeena#Flesh and Fairy Dust|battles of old]] were followed by a capable group of doctors and researchers in the field of **Medicine**. Those built their own section in another district in the city of [[Bavista]].
The **Section VII** **Healing Wind Hospital** is the largest, best equipped, and most specialized healing facility of the country. Besides treating patients, they study bacterial and viral diseases, genetics, and they develop potent modern Pharmaceuticals and potions.

>[!note]+ Notes
>The hospital's name is a reference to the game *Final Fantasy VII*, where **Healing Wind** is a skill of the character *Aerith*.
### Section VIII
	Field: Invis Biology
It took a while until the new country calmed down enough to be able to shift the focus to themselves and their own bodies. Interest in the topic of **Invis Biology** steadily grew in the city of [[Haarafir]], since it was at peace the longest after the country was founded. Also, the primarily [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] nature of the population was especially interesting to explore.
Initially composed of private researchers, a number of them finally decided at some point to share their findings and combine their efforts in the field. An effort that was rewarded with the establishment of the **Section VIII Invis-Garden** (the majority of the researchers where [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]]). The **Garden** nowadays not only deals with **Biology**, but also with topics like **Neuroscience**.

>[!note]+ Notes
>Calling the section *Garden* is a reference to *Final Fantasy VIII's Gardens*, course.
### Section IX
	Fields: Information & Data Science
This section was moved around the most. It started out as a part of [[#Section I]], but was then moved to [[Haarafir]], then [[#Section II]], and back to **Haarafir**, after [[#Section II]]'s satellite began operations. During that time computers became high in demand pretty much all over the country, but especially for the [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]], of course.
It was considered to also be moved to [[Bavista]], but then they basically invented the internet. An upgraded satellite extended a network over the entire country and this way the section's physical location stopped mattering.
Now, the latest in computer software and hardware is researched here. Also **information** in general, **statistics**, **cyber security**, and **AI** are studied here, of course.

>[!note]+ Notes
>The operating system developed for Bardeenian computers is called **Garland OS**, which, of course, is a reference to the *Final Fantasy IX* antagonist of the same name.
### Section X
	Field: Ecology
From the beginning they knew they would have to be careful with the little land they claimed for themselves. They had to use the space and resources they had efficiently and without endangering their future. All Sections tried to do this anyway, but with time it became more complicated.
They thought it best to turn this need into its own section and scientists from other sections, primarily [[#Section I|I]], [[#Section III|III]] and [[#Section IV|IV]] joined together.
The 10th section was born and grew into the **Spira Academy** over time. It deals with matters of **Ecology**, the **Environment**, restoration and recycling, and by extension the circle of life itself.

>[!note]+ Notes
>Another reference to a *Final Fantasy* game. **Spira** is the name of *FFX*'s world.
### Section XI
	Fields: Psychology, Sociology, Learning
After many years, [[#Section VI]] grew a bit too large and it was decided to split it into two. They both still reside near the ruins of **Fodivitas**, [[Nasbel]]. **Section VI** had grown into a temple-like structure, while this became a rather modern office building - a very cozy one, though.
### Section XII
	Field: Secret
The youngest and smallest section was created after the ruins of **Antholopos** where discovered inside the [[Marros]]. During construction of the [[Haarafir#The Ener-Gea|Ener-Gea]] the workers stumbled upon one of many large tunnels that seemingly went through the entire mountain. [[#Section V]] was immediately notified and exploration of the tunnels began.
When they discovered the [[The Capsule Kids|Capsule Kids]] then, they established the **Secret Section XII** to study the 6 children. Nobody found out what they were, nor how they got there, though. The children themselves also didn't give any clues. They seemed to be just normal babies.
So their efforts focused more on waking all of them up, overseeing their growth, and integrating them into their society.
## Secrecy
The oldest and largest of the **Sections** are heavily guarded and house [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]] as well as scientific personnel. They contain very valuable knowledge and tech - left behind by the [[Die Eveliten|Evelites]] or newly developed - and are the most important edge Bardeena has against its enemies.
That is why unauthorized access to any of the sections is prevented from anyone without clearance, civilian or otherwise.
# Department of Innovation
While the [[#Department of Research]] is concerned with gathering knowledge, this one tries to find ways to use it. Experimentation, invention, evaluation and testing of how the discovered things can best be used to benefit the entire country is done extensively here.
## Secrecy
This department is held to the same degree of secrecy, concerning new knowledge and technologies as the [[#Department of Research|research department]] is. This is to keep their technological edge over the world as well as to protect it from harm.
A thing they've learned, e.g. when they first discovered **Evelitian** weapons, was that they had to use caution with new discoveries. A powerful idea or thing handled carelessly could end up doing more damage to themselves than good. That is why their own general public is also kept in the dark about new discoveries at first.
## Process
In order to prevent misuse and potential resulting catastrophes, they established a process of evaluation for each idea sparked from new knowledge. Evaluation is done in teams, often set against each other, until the most promising ideas emerge.
### Ideas
For most ideas this process is over rather quickly. Either because the given idea leads to nothing, or it is small and has a pretty obvious low impact on society as it is. Still, caution dictates to give any idea at least a little time to brew. So all ideas, without exception, have to go through that process, more or less strict.
### Experimentation & Invention
First they experiment with any new piece of knowledge and try to find ways of how it could be incorporated into everyday life. They run experiments, build gadgets, combine it with existing things, until they come up with one or multiple viable use cases. Research scientists are consulted regularly.
### Testing & Iteration
The emerging use cases are refined and iterated over a few times. Not just to make the new discovery as useful as possible, but also to find ways to break and misuse it. This way they hope to identify the most unknown unknowns and turn the new technology into something that is useful and safe.
### Observation & Adjusting
After the testing phase, the new tech, process, or information is handed over to a selected few teams or individuals of other departments (e.g. the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Department of Police|Police]], or the [[The Board of Requirements#Department of Production|Departmetn of Production]]). 
Members of this department will then keep an eye on how it is used. Often, more refinement and testing is necessary until a final evaluation is reached.
### Release
In the end, if the idea passed all tests and concerns, it will be given to the public, i.e. released for mass production or incorporated into the country's common knowledge. Then it benefits every citizen. After a few years of public access, it may even be traded to foreign parties.
## Location
A number of smaller **Innovation Facilities** are spread all over the country's settlements, usually in close proximity to one of the research [[#Sections]]. These facilities are usually protected by a few [[The Bardeena Defense Force|military]] officers, depending on their importance.

**A.T.O.M**
Large impact ideas on the other hand often need a widespread area of land (especially weapons).
For that purpose the **A.T.O.M** testing facility was created, which stands for "Advanced Testing and Observation Mission". It is located on the large peninsula East of [[Bavista]] and is the place where the most dangerous substances and most powerful weapons are tested.
# Department of Education
The Bardeenian system of education, in its entirety, is handled by this department. Most of the schools are publicly funded, but there is also the one or other private one as well. However, all schools have to adhere to certain standards, before introducing their individual twists and processes.
## General
### Diversity
Not only is the nation's population mostly made up of [[Mischlinge|Hybrids]], but all the remaining pure blood citizens are also a mixture of races, cultures, and different [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Levels of Maturity]]. This put the Bardeenian schools in front of a multitude of hard challenges, which they attempted to overcome by developing the schooling system described in the following paragraphs.
Diversity is one of Bardeena's [[Bardeena#Culture|core values]] and is heavily encouraged. The schooling system not only accounts for that, but embraces it fully and tries to foster it as a blessing in all students. Individual learning, progression, and graduation is the result. Individual [[#Classes|subject classes]], interdisciplinary projects, or competitions between different schools are the means. Diversity in culture, age, and skill level is [[#Appreciation Festival|celebrated]], too.
### Classes
Classes, in the classical sense of a class-year, don't exist in this system. However, each individual subject is divided into multiple classes and each class represents a certain skill level of a subject here, too. But each individual student is actually in several different classes at once (*Math I*, *Language IV,* *Chemistry III*, etc.), depending on their respective skills in the the given subject. That means classes are made up of differently aged students with roughly the same skill, but different age and [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Levels of Maturity]].
If a student acquires the required knowledge and skills to advance to the next class (see: [[#Grading]]), they may choose to do so rather quickly. They might also stay on for a while longer, to either practice some more, or help with tutoring their fellow student.
This has an impact on student timetables of course, which may undergo a lot of changes over the course of a year. It also gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships with fellow classmates, at times. To compensate, and to give students a break of course, every school day has an hour of mid-day recess. Additionally, students are encouraged to join extracurricular activities, like study clubs, or just stay in school to doo homework together. This is completely optional, though.
### Grading
To measure the student's acquired knowledge and skill in any given class, teachers grade their students regularly.

> Grades are given via [[Voxciel]] numerals from **I** (lowest) to **X** (highest).

The pass grade is the **V**. At the end of each quarter, the grades are averaged. If a student's average is at least a **V**, they may pass on to the next class for the next quarter.
Most grades are collected via formal exams, which are held at least every 2 weeks. Once a quarter there are multi subject group projects, school competitions, and other events held that are used for grading as well. These also influence a student's [[#Evaluation]] result.
### Evaluation
To determine a student's [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Level of Maturity]], teachers also report regularly on every student's physical and mental development. Since teaching is already rather taxing, every school also has a small staff of psychologists that help with student evaluations as well as giving support to staff or students alike.
### Incentives
Schools are encouraged to honor and reward hard work in every student. However, there are no hard rules to follow in this regard, so every school has their own system. The goal is to incentivize and motivate the students to be the best they can be, e.g.
- Badges of Honor ("I earned that V!", "I defeated this Illness!", "I finally beat class 3!")
- Public recognition for struggling students
- An individual day off, handed out by the teacher
- Mentoring Programs with people from the industry
- Class trips to places where the respective class knowledge is actually needed
### Mentoring
There is a multitude of reasons, many different life circumstances and situations, which may cause a student to struggle in the classes or their lives in general. That is why students have the right to ask for a personal mentor, or get one assigned, if their struggles become known to the school staff in other ways. These mentors will help and guide their students through their struggles, and accompany them until they are not needed anymore.
Examples:
- A student lost a family member and gets regular therapy from a school psychologist
- Another struggles with a certain subject matter and attends personal lessons with a teacher after school
- An older, as in more mature, student helps a group of younger ones with their homework
- A parent steps in to be there for another child, which has trouble at home
The mentor and their students work out individual solutions and plans for the given situation at hand. Some students need more attention, others less.

Anyone can become a mentor. Most mentors are school staff, though. Other students and even private volunteers can be accepted, too, if the student knows them well. Mentors may even assign themselves to students they find exceptionally gifted or promising.
## School Levels
Schools organize themselves into different levels as well, which go from the most basic knowledge to more and more specialized subjects. Some schools only teach at one level, while others expand to a whole campus, teaching at multiple levels.
### Daycare & Kindergarten
These are actually handled by the [[The Ministry of Community#Department of Family|Department of Family]], but also work closely together with this department to prepare the children for what's to come. The teaching happening here is less structured and more concerned with early childhood development then with actual subject matter, tough.
### FUN(damental) School
	German: Grundschule
Here, students learn the absolute basics of the basics of the common knowledge expected in every Bardeenian citizen. All students absolutely have to learn everything this level can teach in order for society to deem them capable of contributing.
##### FUN Subjects:
- **Math & Science** - Basic algebra and geometry, simple physics and chemistry
- **Language & Literature** - Reading, Writing, Speaking, using language
- **History & Home** - Basic local history, handling money, the state organization, housework
- **Sports & Wilderness** - Sports & Health, basic navigation, local Flora & Fauna, basic [[#Section IV|Anomiology]]
- **Arts, Crafts & Music** - Drawing, Painting, Sculpting, Pottery, Singing, Notation, Playing an Instrument
- **Culture & Diversity** - Overview over all the [[Die Invis|Invis]] cultures and religions, rituals, [[Die Mystik|mystic]] pitfalls
##### FUN Graduation
Most children graduate as [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Interactors]] while cases of earlier or later stages are considered normal, too - everyone learns at their own pace. Graduation ceremonies are held every quarter of a year, and graduates receive a so-called **Fundamentals Diploma**.
This diploma theoretically enables them to start a career - an admittedly simple one, but a career nonetheless. However, children have to continue with school until they are **Adults**. So this does not happen often. **Adult** graduates do happen once in a blue moon, though, especially amongst pure-blooded [[Die Forasier|Forasians]]. However, graduation before reaching adulthood is still the norm, even for them.
Afterwards, the school invites all graduates to a graduation celebration, which is usually some form of sports and play festival, like a trip to the arcade or the fair.
### MID(dle) School
	German: Mittelschule
In middle school, subjects build on top of the basic knowledge each student acquired from the previous level. The total number of subjects increases significantly and students therefore have to choose, which they want to learn.
##### MID Subjects
Subjects are divided into categories and students have to **select at least one subject of each** going forward. If they wish, they may also choose more subjects from any given category, as long as there's still capacity on their time table. Optional choices may be dropped at any time.
The following lists all the categories with example subjects for each. Not all subjects are available at all the schools, though, and some build on the knowledge of others and can only be chosen as soon as the required knowledge was acquired:
- **Logical**: Math, Informatics, Statistics, Data Science
- **Language**: Second, Third, Fourth, etc.
- **Natural**: Physics, Biology, Chemistry, [[#Section I|Planetology]], [[#Section IV|Anomiology]]
- **Artistic**: Visual Arts, Performing Arts
- **Cultural**: General or race specific History, [[#Section V|Evetology]]
- **Physical**: Athletics, Gymnastics, Dance, Martial Arts
- **Mystic**:
	- [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Animation|Animations]] - usually in combination with Martial Arts
	- Enchantments - mostly dealing with [[Die Mystik#Mystifizierungen|Mystifications]] of places and objects
	- Gemology - in this case in regard to their **mystic** capabilities
	- Curses - about [[Geister|ghosts]], the [[Besessene|posessed]]
If a school offers a subject, it has to commit to it. That means classes will be held, even if there's only a single student interested in that subject. It only results in free time for the teachers, if no students chose that subject. But that is also subject to change rather quickly, since new students also arrive on a quarterly basis.
##### MID Graduation
Graduation ceremonies are held every quarter of a year here as well. Graduates receive the so-called **Mid Diploma**, which lists all their chosen subjects and how many [[#Classes]] they've completed for each.
How students become eligible for graduation is rather complicated due to the diverse nature of this society. In general they become graduates as soon as they become [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Adults]], or complete all the classes they've chosen.
- **Adults**: Adults may choose to graduate right away, or at any time after. However, as soon as they matured fully (i.e. reached the **Mature** level), they have to graduate at the end of the current quarter. At this point their progress will be locked in.
- **Completed Classes**: Students actually have a fair chance to complete necessary classes in time, since they only need to complete 1 subject in each category, no matter which.
Since most students have their last day of school ever in MID school, the graduation celebration is something at which the students can cut loose one more time. Similar to the German "Abistreich", the students disturb the lessons all over the school, kidnap selected teachers including the school head, and publicly make fun of the entire staff.
### AD(vanced) School
	German: Extraschule
This school is mandatory only for citizens that haven't reached the [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Adult]] level, yet. It expands on and deepens the teachings of [[#Mid(dle) School|Mid School]] further, which is considered completely optional. That is why students have complete freedom with which subjects they choose to continue. They might even choose not to continue at all and become **Junior Teachers** instead.
- Schooling on this level still remains free for students that haven't fully matured. Anyone else, will have to start paying for classes, though.
- Schools offering the **Advanced Level** are all primarily [[#Mid(dle) School|Mid School]]s. Not all **Mid Schools** offer the **Advanced Level**, but there are no schools for the **Advanced Level** only.
- This is also the first level were students from all over the country may attend. Students from the previous levels may only visit schools in their home settlements.
##### AD Subjects
Besides offering a few more classes for all [[#Mid Subjects|Mid School Subjects]], a school dependent selection of **Advanced Subjects** may be offered as well. While school still stayed rather general up to this point, these subjects are already rather specialized and might go deeper into the matter. Here are some examples:

| Business | Philosophy              | Ethics              | Psychology | Combat Animations  |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Economy  | Computer Science        | Robotics            | Neurology  | Theology           |
| Finance  | Theoretical Mathematics | Theoretical Physics | Medicine   | Competative Sports |
##### AD Graduation
Graduation works similar to [[#Mid Graduation]], but the deadline is extended until [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Maturity]]. So every no-**Adult** student has to stay until they are an **Adult**, and everyone will graduate at the end of the next quarter as soon as they turned **Mature**.
The graduation celebration on this level is a formal dance, not unlike the American Prom, where students dress up, meet at a venue, and dance through the night.
### University
University is completely optional and is only required, if the goal is to become part of one of the [[#Sections]]. Other than that, it is pretty much the same, as one would expect (students, professors, lectures, diplomas, doctorates, etc.).
Not all students end up in the **Sections**, though. Many of them also become other kinds of experts, hired or private, and make a living that way.
Since studying is optional, it has to be paid for, and all the ways imaginable exist in Bardeena, too. (Student loans, scholarships, part time jobs, rich parents, etc.)
### Special Cases
The previous paragraphs described the general way of how its supposed to work for the general population. However, individual exceptions to the rules may also be applied, if justified by circumstances, e.g. immigrants, special-needs citizens, or [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Mature]] adults that want to learn.
If possible, those are integrated into the general process, if they so wish.
Otherwise, there is also a number of evening education programs, which aim to close any potential holes in any individuals common knowledge. In any case, a [[#Mentoring|Mentor]] gets assigned to help along the way, and evaluate personal progress and motivation.
## Holidays & Festivals
Celebrations and break times often go hand in hand in Bardeenian schools. Many themed festivities are planned around the holidays.
### Holidays
students have about 12 weeks of vacation distributed over the year, in addition to and planned around the country's [[Bardeena#National Holidays|National Holidays]]. Ignoring the inital [[Bardeena#The Weekend|Weekends]] those are:
- **New Year Holidays**:  Teyember 24th until Lyruar 6th (2 weeks)
- **Friendsharing Holidays**: 24th of Tebuar until Veril 6th (2 weeks)
- **Wilder Break**: 1st of Gorust until 6th of gorust (1 week)
- **Spring Holidays**: 7th of Bolember until 7th of Forai (5 weeks)
- **Harvest Break**: 12th of Eveli until 18th of Eveli (1 week)
- **Illaween Holidays**:  24th of Rovember until 30th of Rovember (1 week)
### Appreciation Festival
The most important festival all schools have to organize is the annual **Appreciation Festival**. It is held every year during the last week before the [[#Holidays|Spring Holidays]] (1st-4th of Bolember).
During that week, the entire school is treated to a number of workshops, talent shows, cultural rituals, and other presentations that celebrate learning in diversity. The audiences as well as the organizers are made up of students, parents, teachers, other staff, and even the general public in some cases.
This is a good opportunity for students to show off their skills or improve their [[#Grading|grades]]. Parents and teachers, students too, also have the opportunity to put on any show they like. Anything goes!
The festival ends with the great award ceremony on the last day. Students, who struggled a lot this year and finally overcame a challenge, as well as anyone from the staff going above and beyond, are awarded and honored publicly.
After that everyone is sent off into the holidays.
## Teachers 
Teachers in Bardeenian schools are as divers as the classes they teach. To become a teacher, they have to proof themselves knowledgably in the subject they teach, and capable to lead a class. Formal degrees or certificates don't matter much in this regard, since teachers are regularly evaluated, too.
First and foremost, they are tested on how well they work with and motivate the students. A teacher has to be kind and supportive. They have to encourage diversity and curiosity, motivate the students to ask questions, treat mistakes and errors as something precious, and handle disputes respectfully. They have to emphasize with their students, and acknowledge individual and team struggles, efforts and accomplishments.
Second, they are evaluated on the lastest knowledge approved by the [[#Sections]]. Teachers, similar to students, have to earn their right to teach certain classes and are given licenses depending on their knowledge. E.g. a **Class V License** enables a teacher to teach up to Class V in the given subject. A license can be revoked, if new knowledge is available, but is then easily regained by joining a teacher's class. These classes are usually taught by a member of the respective **Section** and the knowledge is then integrated into normal teaching right away.
Evaluations might be separated into these two parts or also done at the same time during normal class hours. It varies greatly who does the actual evaluations, but it should be someone who is versed enough. If the teacher doubts that, they can always ask for a second and third opinion before a final decision is made.
## The Grind
Students may go through the first three [[#School Levels|Levels of School]] without interruptions (FUN to AD), but as soon as they are finished with school they do the **Grind**. The **Grind** is a period of 2 mandatory years during which each citizens **must** work in a so-called **Grind-Job**, hence the name.

**Grind-Jobs** are rather low paying, less valued occupations, which don't require a lot of education, but may still be rather hard and unfulfilling. A.k.a. jobs nobody is particularly eager to do, like:
- Helping in the health and nursing sector
- Delivering mail for the post office
- Working as cashiers or filling the shelves in supermarkets
- Driving delivery trucks or packaging goods
- Working in gastronomy as waiters or frying burgers
- etc.
Everyone can choose to work in these jobs anyway, of course, but freshly graduated students have to do it at least for 2 years. They have to choose a job in the beginning and may change to another after the first year. Alternatively, students may join any of the departments from the [[The Bardeena Defense Force|Defense Force]] and **grind away** as police, disaster control, or military recruits.

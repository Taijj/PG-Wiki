Some families might practice their own traditional coming of age ceremony, which is dependent on the respective tradition, of course. However, generally, in this Hybrid society, it is hard to define at which age a child has reached a certain level of maturity. Instead, tests and processes were developed to do so. Those tests put the child in one of the following categories and dictate where it can go:  

## Levels of Maturity
In this [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] society, it is basically impossible to define when an individual has reached maturity.

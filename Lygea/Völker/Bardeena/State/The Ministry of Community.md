	German: Ministerium der Gemeinschaft

The ministry's main concerns are the regulation and organization of how the citizens of the nation are living together. It takes care to preserve a sense of culture, sets rules of how people should live together, and sets certain standards everyone can rely on.
The rules set here are not as strong as a hard set laws would be, the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Department of Police|Police]] won't enforce them, for instance. But they will hold high authority during conflicts, especially in [[The National Office#Department of Law|court]].
# Department of Preservation
To preserve the nation's culture, its art, its music, and its history, this department was founded. The cultural footprint of Bardeena itself is admittedly weak, due to it being and embracing its multicultural nature. That is why they also take care to preserve what they can from all over Lygea.
## Organization
The main way to fulfill their function is the operation of public libraries, museums, and archives all over the country. Records of many things are kept, stored, and preserved meticulously. Those include but are not limited to: Paintings, sculptures, books, poems, newspaper articles, letters, musical records, movies, and even Videogames.
## Location
Each settlement may or may not have its own library or archives operated by this department. However, the **Hybrid Archives** near the old ruins of **Fodivitas** deserve the title of headquarters the most.
# Department of Presentation
The base of the Bardeenian culture and art scene sprang from this department. Its responsibilities lie in the presentation and celebration of culture in all forms and colors imaginable.
## Sub Departments
Individuals belong to any one of these, but projects are often realized by mixing people from the following together:
- **The Artisans**: Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Fashion, Light shows, i.e. Visual Arts
- **The Collective**: Theatre, Musical, Acting, i.e. Performing Arts
- **The Ensemble**: Concerts, Orchestras, Bands, i.e. Musical Arts
- **The Media**: Movies, TV, Radio, the news, i.e. Visual Media
- **The Writers**: Novels, Poetry, Comics, Books, i.e. Printed Media
- **The Designers**: Videogames & the Web, i.e. Digital Media
## Location
The most notable locations are the big opera house, that was discovered and restored in the ancient city of **Fodivitas**, and the large media transmission tower located in [[Bavista]]. Other smaller theatres, concert halls, or studios can be found all over the country.
# Department of Mysticism
This department prevents total [[Die Elemente|elemental]] anarchy from running wild through the streets of the cities. It creates rules that restrict the usage of [[Die Mystik|mystic]] abilities, to protect citizens and property from harm.
## Hard Rules
The rules set here, similar to the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Citizens in Arms|weapon rules]], are some of the hardest rules set for the nation. Breaking them will get the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Department of Police|Police]] on your case, if you want to or not. They are the closest thing to laws this country has, and upholding them is taken very seriously.
## Rules & Licenses
- [[#Levels of Maturity|Teenagers]] or younger citizens may only **animate** while being supervised closely by a **Mature Adult** on private property whose owner has given their consent. The supervisor will take full responsibility.
- **Adults** may only **animate** on private property whose owner has given their consent, and take full responsibility of their actions.
- **Occupational License**: This license enables its owner to **animate** the [[Die Elemente|Elements]] as part of their occupational duties only while fulfilling said duties.
- **Public License**: This license enables its owner to **animate** the **Elements** in public under the obligation of greatest care.
- **Enforcer's License**: This license enables its owner to **animate** the **Elements** as the means to attack and defend themselves and others from harm, or as a means to enforce peace.
## Process
Citizens can apply for any of the previously listed licenses, as soon as they become **Adults**. A license is rather expensive, though, and requires participation in a special training program. A higher tier license requires the applicant to complete the previous tiers first. So, in order to acquire an **Enforcer's License**, an **Occupational** and a **Public License** have to be acquired first, including payment and training.
For people joining any department in [[The Bardeena Defense Force]], acquiring the **Enforcer's License** is part of the recruitment process and comes without additional costs.
## Location
Police stations, army barracks, or even schools often employ representatives of this department that organize and oversee the licensing processes. Department headquarters are situated in the harbor city of [[Bavista]].
# Department of Healthcare
Ensuring the physical and mental health of all Bardeenian citizens is the main objective of this department.
## Free Healthcare
Bardeena has a system of free healthcare for all citizens. This even includes transport to and, if necessary, from the clinic by [[The Bardeena Defense Force#The Ambulance|an ambulance]]. This, however, has its limits. If a patient is behaving suspiciously, doctors, after consulting one another, might decide to stop treatment, ask for a fee, or suggest alternative treatment. After all they don't want to waste resource on someone trying to exploit the system or whose lifestyle is plainly bad.
## Obligations 
All medical personal swears an oath to treat the sick to the best of their ability, to heal injuries, to protect their patient's privacy, and to pass on their knowledge to anyone willing to listen. They also swear to protect the patient's dignity, which gives the patient the power to refuse treatment and explicitly allows active euthanasia.
## Location
A number of smaller and larger single practices of doctors, physicians, physiotherapists, psychotherapists, etc. can be found all over the country. Usually the [[The National Office#Department of Resources|Department of Resources]] keeps an eye this distribution and arranges the creation or downsizing of practices in any given area, depending on population density.
Only the big cities have hospitals, usually more than one, too. The largest and best equipped one is the [[The Institute of Science#Section VII|Healing Wind Hospital]] in [[Bavista]].
# Department of Family
The protection of families and the innocence of childhood is this department's mission. It also takes on the responsibility of keeping families in check.
## Daycare & Kindergarten
Care and education of very young children is considered to mainly be the responsibility of the parents and their existing family. Parents can choose to place their kids into daycare or kindergarten, but need to go through an application process first. A lot of factors are considered and reviewed for a child to be accepted, though. Most important among them are:
- The parent's occupation and severity of them not doing it for a while (e.g. health workers have an easier time getting their children into daycare than office workers do) 
- The parent's available family network (grandparents, aunts/uncles, friends)
- The parent's physical and mental resilience
- The child's [[#Levels of Maturity|Level of Maturity]]
There is a great number of children that won't go to daycare or kindergarten, since they are embedded in a good family situation as is already.
## Levels of Maturity
In this [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] society, it is basically impossible to define when an individual has reached maturity based on age. Instead, together with and based on extensive research done by [[The Institute of Science#Section XI|Section XI]], this department came up with distinct stages every [[Die Invis|Invis]] goes through. These were based on observable and quantifiable **behavioral traits** and milestones to be mastered:

*(Equivalent: Equivalent human age or terms)*

The Bardeenian [[The Institute of Science#Department of Education|system of education]] was developed in parallel. Respective coming of age ceremonies or rituals vary from family to family depending on personal traditions and culture, of course.
## Community Balance
One of the department's most important ongoing tasks is to keep the population in balance. Together with the [[The National Office#Department of Demographics|Department of Demographics]] they actually strive to keep a balance between population growth and decline.

To realize this, they've developed a numerical model, to predict and evaluate future population growth. Each pregnancy, and each immigration application, will influence this **Population Index**, which determines the respective measures to be taken:
- **White** - The population will shrink drastically, child birth is incentivized with monetary bonusses, immigrants are actively sought out.
- **Blue** - The population will shrink, immigrants won't be evaluated so strictly.
- **Green** - The population should roughly stay the same
- **Yellow** - The population will grow, immigrants have to work a little harder to be accepted, to-be parents won't receive their basic income anymore
- **Red** - The population will grow beyond what the country can provide for, no immigrants are allowed in, parents won't receive their basic income and their babies will be taken away at birth.

> [!note]+ Trivia
> - The Population Index has never reached a lower level than Green. It reached red a few times, but usually alternates between the Yellow and Green stages.
> - There have been cases of unreasonable parents that were forcefully sterilized in addition to having their children taken away.

Abortions, within a certain time after the pregnancy was discovered, are also legal. If penalties are given, they take care to apply them to the would-be parents, since the children are actually innocent. If a child was born, it is entitled to be treated as a full Bardeenian citizen, though.
## Domestic Violence
This department also steps in for cases of domestic violence of any kind. They separate children from abusive caretakers, partners from abusive spouses, or any similar situation that warrants interference. 
## Orphanages
The Bardeenian definition of an orphanage is a little different than the word might imply. Anyone, with no family connection or home of their own is considered an orphan, regardless of age and [[#Levels of Maturity|Level of Maturity]].
Bardeenian orphanages are intergenerational nursing homes for children, the elderly, or any other person in need. This way many functional families form that aren't actually blood related at all.
# Department of Standardization
Also, makes rules that hold weight in court, and can be used to "sue" somebody.

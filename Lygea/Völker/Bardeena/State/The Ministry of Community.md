	German: Ministerium der Gemeinschaft

The ministry's main concerns are the regulation and organization of how the citizens of the nation are living together. It takes care to preserve a sense of culture, sets rules of how people should live together, and sets certain standards everyone can rely on.
The rules set here are not as strong as a hard set laws would be, the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Department of Police|Police]] won't enforce them, for instance. But they will hold high authority during conflicts, especially in [[The National Office#Department of Law|court]].
# Department of Preservation
To preserve the nation's culture, its art, its music, and its history, this department was founded. The cultural footprint of Bardeena itself is admittedly weak, due to it being and embracing its multicultural nature. That is why they also take care to preserve what they can from all over Lygea.
## Organization
The main way to fulfill their function is the operation of public libraries, museums, and archives all over the country. Records of many things are kept, stored, and preserved meticulously. Those include but are not limited to: Paintings, sculptures, books, poems, newspaper articles, letters, musical records, movies, and even Videogames.
## Location
Each settlement may or may not have its own library or archives operated by this department. However, the **Hybrid Archives** near the old ruins of **Fodivitas** deserve the title of headquarters the most.
# Department of Presentation
The base of the Bardeenian culture and art scene sprang from this department. Its responsibilities lie in the presentation and celebration of culture in all forms and colors imaginable.
## Sub Departments
Individuals belong to any one of these, but projects are often realized by mixing people from the following together:
- **The Artisans**: Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Fashion, Light shows, i.e. Visual Arts
- **The Collective**: Theatre, Musical, Acting, i.e. Performing Arts
- **The Ensemble**: Concerts, Orchestras, Bands, i.e. Musical Arts
- **The Media**: Movies, TV, Radio, the news, i.e. Visual Media
- **The Writers**: Novels, Poetry, Comics, Books, i.e. Printed Media
- **The Designers**: Videogames & the Web, i.e. Digital Media
## Location
The most notable locations are the big opera house, that was discovered and restored in the ancient city of **Fodivitas**, and the large media transmission tower located in [[Bavista]]. Other smaller theatres, concert halls, or studios can be found all over the country.
# Department of Mysticism
This department prevents total [[Die Elemente|elemental]] anarchy from running wild through the streets of the cities. It creates rules that restrict the usage of [[Die Mystik|mystic]] abilities, to protect citizens and property from harm.
## Hard Rules
The rules set here, similar to the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Citizens in Arms|weapon rules]], are some of the hardest rules set for the nation. Breaking them will get the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#Department of Police|Police]] on your case, if you want to or not. They are the closest thing to laws this country has, and upholding them is taken very seriously.
## Rules & Licenses
- [[#Levels of Maturity|Teenagers]] or younger citizens may only **animate** while being supervised closely by a **Mature Adult** on private property whose owner has given their consent. The supervisor will take full responsibility.
- **Adults** may only **animate** on private property whose owner has given their consent, and take full responsibility of their actions.
- **Occupational License**: This license enables its owner to **animate** the [[Die Elemente|Elements]] as part of their occupational duties only while fulfilling said duties.
- **Public License**: This license enables its owner to **animate** the **Elements** in public under the obligation of greatest care.
- **Enforcer's License**: This license enables its owner to **animate** the **Elements** as the means to attack and defend themselves and others from harm, or as a means to enforce peace.
## Process
Citizens can apply for any of the previously listed licenses, as soon as they become **Adults**. A license is rather expensive, though, and requires participation in a special training program. A higher tier license requires the applicant to complete the previous tiers first. So, in order to acquire an **Enforcer's License**, an **Occupational** and a **Public License** have to be acquired first, including payment and training.
For people joining any department in [[The Bardeena Defense Force]], acquiring the **Enforcer's License** is part of the recruitment process and comes without additional costs.
## Location
Police stations, army barracks, or even schools often employ representatives of this department that organize and oversee the licensing processes. Department headquarters are situated in the harbor city of [[Bavista]].

(Kinder & Jugendhilfe) Domestic, Daycare, Kindergarten'n shit

Care and education of very young children is considered to mainly be the responsibility of the parents and their existing family. Parents can choose to place their kids into daycare or kindergarten, but need to go through an application process in order for their children to be accepted into one. A lot of factors are considered and reviewed for a child to be accepted. Most important among them are:
- The parent's occupation and severity of them not doing it for a while (e.g. health workers have an easier time getting their children into daycare than office workers do)    
- The parent's available family network (grandparents, aunts/uncles, friends)    
- The child's level of maturity
Some families might practice their own traditional coming of age ceremony, which is dependent on the respective tradition, of course. However, generally, in this Hybrid society, it is hard to define at which age a child has reached a certain level of maturity. Instead, tests and processes were developed to do so. Those tests put the child in one of the following categories and dictate where it can go:  
## Levels of Maturity
In this [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] society, it is basically impossible to define based on age when an individual has reached maturity. Instead, together with and based on extensive research done by [[The Institute of Science#Section XI|Section XI]], this department came up with distinct stages every [[Die Invis|Invis]] goes through. These were base on observable and quantifiable **behavioral traits** and milestones to be mastered:

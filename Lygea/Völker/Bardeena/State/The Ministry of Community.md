Some families might practice their own traditional coming of age ceremony, which is dependent on the respective tradition, of course. However, generally, in this Hybrid society, it is hard to define at which age a child has reached a certain level of maturity. Instead, tests and processes were developed to do so. Those tests put the child in one of the following categories and dictate where it can go:  

## Levels of Maturity
In this [[Mischlinge|Hybrid]] society, it is basically impossible to define based on age when an individual has reached maturity. Instead, together with and based on extensive research done by [[The Institute of Science#Section XI|Section XI]], this department came up with distinct stages every [[Die Invis|Invis]] goes through. These were base on observable and quantifiable **behavioral traits** and milestones to be mastered:

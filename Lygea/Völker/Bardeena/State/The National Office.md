	German: Ratsbüro

The National Office is an organizational body from the state of [[Bardeena]]. It is responsible for all matters of "state". Its departments take care of internal administration and external representation.
# Department of Law
This department steps in, if two or more conflicting parties require extensive external arbitration. They employ lawyers and judges to hold rather classic trials with a prosecution,  defense, and to reach a concluding verdict to resolve the given conflict.
## Jury
While the judges mediate and organized the trials, an actual verdict is reached by a jury of randomly selected or volunteering citizens. Being invited to such a trial is viewed as huge honor. Participants are officially excused from their other daily responsibilities, too, so an invitation like that is rarely rejected.
The department does not step in automatically, and something like hard laws don't exist in Bardeena. Still, once the department is getting involved, and a verdict is reached, that verdict has to be kept. If necessary, the [[The Bardeena Defense Force#The Department of Police|Department of Police]] will enforce it.

The jury is encouraged to pass verdicts that are fair and based on the truth. There doesn't have to be a clear winner or looser to a trial. Often verdicts get passed that admit some degree of fault for all involved parties.
Though most penalties are resolved with monetary compensation, they are highly versatile and may reach from a stern warning to a death sentence. But the costs for the trials themselves and respective investigations are usually also piled on whoever "lost" the trial. This pretty much ensures that trials are really only held, if necessary.
## Location
The department really only has two big headquarters:
- **The Communal Court** (Bürgergericht) in [[Haarafir]], and
- **The City Court** (Stadtgericht) in [[Bavista]].
Smaller Bardeenian communities usually hold their own trials, but may send for one of the city judges, if necessary.
# Department of Diplomacy
Taking care of the relationships with other nations is the business of this department. It organizes a number of embassies and ambassadors to send to negotiations with foreign partners, new allies, or enemies. It takes care of representing the interests of the country, negotiates imports and exports, and is the first point of contact for foreign requests.  

To be close to the work, the department's headquarters, and most branches, are based in [[Bavista]]. They basically only trade with the [[Die Dragnarier|Dragnarians]], who then get goods and wares from their global routes from other countries. Sending ambassadors directly to other continents is a plan, which has yet to be put into practice.
# Department of Resources
The administration of the nation's own stock of goods, finances, and available workforce is this department's job. It works closely together with the [[The Board of Requirements#Department of Distribution|Department of Distribution]] to make sure the  available resources are used fairly and efficiently.  
## Responsibilities
Amongst its major responsibilities are:
- Take inventory of available resources (money, goods, people), and log what they are used for.
- Keep a buffer of resources ready and make sure they are rationed properly for tough times.
- Keep an up to date index of citizens that volunteer to be called upon in emergency situations.
- Storage Management 
## Prices
The country's banks and treasuries are organized by this department. Money, though tracked and available digitally, is still backed up by stored [[Bitts]]. Bardeena does not have a stock market, and prices for goods are instead determined and regulated by this department.
Multiple factors play a role when a product is priced, like availability, ease of manufacturing, transport costs, quality and more.
## Location
The department is divided into a vast number of stores, warehouses and banks all over the country. They mainly sit in the big cities of [[Haarafir]] and [[Bavista]], but [[Nasbel]] has its own bank, too.
# Department of Demographics
This one keeps an eye on the demographic development of the country. It organizes and evaluates a number of surveys and collects the gathered data into statistics.
## Living Space
Since the wilderness is still a dangerous place, an expansion of the available living space in the cities is rather hard. So its also a large part of this department's job, to keep an eye on population size relative to the available housing on the market. It works closes with the [[The Board of Requirements#Department of Infrastructure|Department of Infrastructure]] to make sure, every citizen has a place to live.
## Citizenship
Every candidate, newborn or immigrant, has to register here, to become an actual citizen of Bardeena. Once a citizen, the person becomes eligible to receive [[The Board of Requirements#The Department of Distribution|citizen benefits]].
## Location
There is a demographic bureau in each of Bardeena's settlements. Their sizes and complexity are proportional to the size of the respective settlement, of course. The largest one is located at harbor of [[Bavista]].

	German: Bedürnisbehörde

One of the 5 organizational bodies of the [[Bardeena|Bardeenian]] nation. The board takes care of the nation's own production, maintenance, and other needs. It also handles equal and fair distribution of internal resources between the "state" and its citizens.
# Department of Distribution
While the [[The National Office#The Department of Resources|Department of Resources]] takes care of storing, saving, and cataloging resources (supply), this one makes sure they are used properly (demand). All all parts of the country should get what they need to fulfill their function.
## Money
One of the main tasks for this department is to distribute the country's common wealth fairly amongst the citizens, companies, projects, or wherever it might be needed otherwise. Money spent internally will then usually circle back around again, which keeps the economy alive. Money spent externally, e.g. for the imports of goods, is overseen by the [[The National Office#Department of Diplomacy|Department of Diplomacy]].
The fair distribution of [[Bitts]] is realized by the following devices:
- **Universal Income**: First and foremost, Bardeena has implemented a system for universal income that is granted to each citizen, no matter the age. This ensures general survival and material safety for everyone, has no strings attached, and is granted for life. (You won't be rich, but you won't have to starve, either.) The amount for children depends on the child's [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Level of Maturity]] and changes while the child grows. Until it is matured, the money is given to the parents.
- **Modifiers**: These will de-/increase the amount of money a citizen may get depending on individual factors. People with special needs, e.g. chronical illnesses or disabilities usually get a bit more, while others may decrease their amount to pay of a debt or a [[The National Office#Department of Law|sentence]]. 
- **Budgets**: Every company or project can get funding for any kind of endeavor they plan to undertake (e.g. founding a startup). Budgets are only granted with a proper application, though, which will be evaluated thoroughly and individually in each case. Budgets may be extended or cancelled, if deemed necessary.
- **Bonusses**: Individual one time payments may be granted to any individual, a company, or a project for extraordinary deeds and accomplishments.
## Goods
With all the money given away, the department also has to ensure there is enough it can be spent on. The Goods produced by the [[#Department of Production]] need to be made available in stores, shops, and supermarkets across the country. So the two departments work closely together to make it happen.
They have a transport fleet and the overview about what kind of wares are needed where. They open and close shops as needed, and transport the goods to them.
## Locations
The department doesn't have centralized headquarters. There is a number of offices of varying sizes everywhere in the country, for the more bureaucratic tasks. The stores, also variable in size, are usually coupled with one or multiple manufacturers from the [[#Department of Production|Production Department]], depending on their chosen clientele. E.g. a specific clothing manufacturer (like "*Ego Trash*") might have a number of smaller specialized stores they sent their wares to, while a chain of supermarkets gets wares from a number of food producers.
# Department of Production
This department is concerned with the gathering of natural resources and the production of goods. Imported raw materials also end up here to be processed into something usable. Although a large number of machines and even robots are used, this department contains by far the largest 
workforce of the entire country.
## Sub Departments
Various products are produced in Bardeena every day, so these factions emerged to make organization easier:
- **The** (Manufacturer's) **Union**: Factory workers, assembly lines, shifts (blue collar)
- **The** (Farmer's) **Club**: Agriculture and livestock, farmers
- **The** (Crafter's) **Gild**: Office and creative workers (white collar)
## Locations
The Union and Gild have a multitude of sometimes competing production facilities and brands usually inside the big cities, namely [[Haarafir]] and [[Bavista]]. The Club on the other hand really only operates from the village of [[Nasbel]], where nearly all of the country's own food comes from.
# Department of Infrastructure
This department takes care of the functional systems without which the society could not work properly. It builds, extends, and maintains the country's fundamental infrastructure.
## Sub Departments
### The Power Company
Electricity is seen as a basic societal need and is provided for free wherever it is needed. The bigger cities have their own power plants, while the smaller villages, settlements, and outposts usually get their power from one or multiple generators. 
How the power is distributed may vary greatly between settlements. [[Haarafir]], for example, has the [[Haarafir#The Ener-Gea|Ener-Gea]] power plant, which distributes electricity mostly above ground.
### The Housing Market
The citizens are generally free to build their own houses, but they may also rent or buy a residence from the Housing Market. Due to the limited space inside the walls of each settlement, it is necessary to keep a close eye on the available living space and see that it is not overused.
That is why new buildings are usually built only, if old ones are torn down first.
Still, the goal is to not only provide a home for every citizen, but to also give them some options. That is why the city walls are extended, if necessary. But this is rather rare due to the effort it takes.
### The Post Office
Handles postage and delivery of physical mail, be it letters or packages, just as you would expect them to work.
### The Network
Colloquially referred to as simply *The Net*, they provide the necessary cabling and network coverage for telephone, mobile, internet and TV broadcasting. These services are considered optional and can only be used with additional costs. Every citizen can freely choose which service to connect to, though.
### The Wheeled Fleet
Everything concerning the nation's public transportation system is handled by *The Fleet*. Building, demolition, and maintenance of public trains, subways, trams, busses, and even taxis are handled here.
Inner city transportation (tram, subway, bus) can be used for free, but longer or more comfortable options (e.g. taxis) need extra payment.
### The Road Builders
Building roads, sidewalks, railways, or even public places and parks are tasks for the crew of roadbuilders. 
### The Waste Collectors
Collection as well as safe disposal of the nation's trash is the mission here. There are even nation wide guidelines on how to separate the trash and the citizens of Bardeena are usually very thorough with this, too. A carelessly tossed piece of trash might even bring you before the [[The National Office#Department of Law|The Department of Law]]. 
## Organization
Various companies make up this department, which often also work closely together depending on the task at hand. There's usually one major company for each of the sub-departments, which are nationally funded and absolutely have to guarantee working conditions in their respective fields.
Smaller private companies also exists, which have to make their own living with contracted work.
# A word about competition
Bardeena's society is loosely based on the ideas of [Social Anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anarchism). However, there's still traces of classic economic competition to be found here, too. The country tries to ensure a base standard of living for everyone, but above that its pretty similar to a free market.
That being said, each part has its own twist on the whole concept, which heavily varies even down to the individual team level.

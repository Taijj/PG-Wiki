	German: Bedürnisbehörde

One of the 5 organizational bodies of the [[Bardeena|Bardeenian]] nation. The board takes care of the nation's own production, maintenance, and other needs. It also handles equal and fair distribution of internal resources between the "state" and its citizens.
# Department of Distribution
While the [[The National Office#The Department of Resources|Department of Resources]] takes care of storing, saving, and cataloging resources, this one makes sure they are used properly. All all parts of the country should get what they need to fulfill their function.
## Money
One of the main tasks for this department is to distribute the country's common wealth fairly amongst the citizens, companies, projects, or wherever it might be needed otherwise. Money spent internally will then usually circle back around again, which keeps the economy alive. Money spent externally, e.g. for the imports of goods, is overseen by the [[The National Office#Department of Diplomacy|Department of Diplomacy]].
The fair distribution of [[Bitts]] is realized by the following devices:
- **Universal Income**: First and foremost, Bardeena has implemented a system for universal income that is granted to each citizen, no matter the age. This ensures general survival and material safety for everyone, has no strings attached, and is granted for life. (You won't be rich, but you won't have to starve, either.) The amount for children depends on the child's [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Level of Maturity]] and changes while the child grows. Until it is matured, the money is given to the parents.
- **Modifiers**: These will de-/increase the amount of money a citizen may get depending on individual factors. People with special needs, e.g. chronical illnesses or disabilities usually get a bit more, while others may decrease their amount to pay of a debt or a [[The National Office#Department of Law|sentence]]. 
- **Budgets**: Every company or project can get funding for any kind of endeavor they plan to undertake (e.g. founding a startup). Budgets are only granted with a proper application, though, which will be evaluated thoroughly and individually in each case. Budgets may be extended or cancelled, if deemed necessary.
- **Bonusses**: Individual one time payments may be granted to any individual, a company, or a project for extraordinary deeds and accomplishments.
## Goods
With all the money given away, the department also has to ensure there is enough it can be spent on. The Goods produced by the [[#Department of Production]] need to be made available in stores, shops, and supermarkets across the country. So the two departments work closely together to make it happen.
They have a transport fleet and the overview about what kind of wares are needed where. They open and close shops as needed, and transport the goods to them.
## Locations
The department doesn't have centralized headquarters. There is a number of offices of varying sizes everywhere in the country, for the more bureaucratic tasks. The stores, also variable in size, are usually coupled with one or multiple manufacturers from the [[#Department of Production|Production Department]], depending on their chosen clientele. E.g. a specific clothing manufacturer (like "*Ego Trash*") might have a number of smaller specialized stores they sent their wares to, while a chain of supermarkets gets wares from a number of food producers.
# Department of Production
This department is concerned with the gathering of natural resources and the production of goods. Imported raw materials also end up here to be processed into something usable. Although a large number of machines and even robots are used, this department contains by far the largest 
workforce of the entire country.
## Sub departments
Various products are produced in Bardeena every day, so these su-departments emerged to make organization easier:
- **The** (Manufacturer's) **Union**: Factory workers, assembly lines, shifts (blue collar)
- **The** (Farmer's) **Club**: Agriculture and livestock, farmers
- **The** (Crafter's) **Gild**: Office and creative workers (white collar)
## Locations
The Union and Gild have a multitude of sometimes competing production facilities and brands usually inside the big cities, namely [[Haarafir]] and [[Bavista]]. The Club on the other hand really only operates from the village of [[Nasbel]], where nearly all of the country's own food comes from.
# Department of Infrastructure

This department is made up of a variety of sub-departments, which take care to build, extend, and maintain the country's infrastructure:

- The Power Company - which takes care of electricity production and distribution.
    
- The Housing Market - which builds and maintains houses and appartments to be sold or rented to the public
    
- The Post Office - which takes care of the country mail.
    
- The V-Net - the cable companies that take care of broadcasting networks, for telephone, raidio, TV, and internet
    
- The Publics - which takes care to organize public transportation, and taxi services.
    
- The Road Builders - that builds and maintains the city streets
- Garbage Disposal
    

  

Various companies make up this department, often with multiple closely related responsibilities.

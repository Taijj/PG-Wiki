	German: Bedürnisbehörde

One of the 5 organizational bodies of the [[Bardeena|Bardeenian]] nation. The board takes care of the nation's own production, maintenance, and other needs. It also handles equal and fair distribution of internal resources between the "state" and its citizens.
## Department of Distribution
While the [[The National Office#The Department of Resources|Department of Resources]] takes care of storing, saving, and cataloging resources, this one makes sure they are used properly. All all parts of the country should get what they need to fulfill their function.
## Universal Income
First and foremost, Bardeena has implemented a system for a universal income that is granted to each citizen, no matter the age. This ensures general survival and material safety for everyone, has no strings attached, and is granted for life. (You won't be rich, but you won't have to starve, either.)
The amount for children depends on the child's [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Level of Maturity]] and changes while the child grows. Until it is matured, the money is given to the parents.
## Budgeting
- Budgeting: Each company of each Department, as well as individual projects are granted a set budget, which is determined by the respective endeavour. Budgets can be extended or cut as needed.    
- Bonusses: Bonusses are granted for individuals with special needs, e.g. chronical illnesses or disabilites, as well as for everyone who performed some kind of outstanding service for the benefit of the country or parts of it.    
- Logistics: The transport and distribution of goods, e.g. to shops, stores, and supermarkets across the country, are also done by this department.  

The department doesn't have centralized headquarters and is separated into offices of varying sizes all over the country.

## Department of Production

Consists of two distinct parts that closely work together to produce a variety of goods:

- The Gild (of Manufacturers) distributed in various factories all over the country, and
    
- The Farmer's Union (Agriculture) which mainly operates from the village of Nasbel.
    

This department contains by far the largest workforce of the entire country. It makes sure the available natural resources are gathered, maintained, and turned into useful goods for the citizens themselves or to be traded away to other countries.

## Department of Infrastructure

This department is made up of a variety of sub-departments, which take care to build, extend, and maintain the country's infrastructure:

- The Power Company - which takes care of electricity production and distribution.
    
- The Housing Market - which builds and maintains houses and appartments to be sold or rented to the public
    
- The Post Office - which takes care of the country mail.
    
- The V-Net - the cable companies that take care of broadcasting networks, for telephone, raidio, TV, and internet
    
- The Publics - which takes care to organize public transportation, and taxi services.
    
- The Road Builders - that builds and maintains the city streets
    

  

Various companies make up this department, often with multiple closely related responsibilities.

	German: Landeswehr

In short, these are the [[Bardeena|Bardeenian]] executive forces. They establish order and take care of the country's inner and outer defenses. As with the rest of the country, hierarchies can be rather loose here as well, at least during normal operations. However, in situations of emergency and quick decision necessity, these hierarchies tighten considerably and ranks become important, of course.
# Department of War
Primarily responsible for the defense against external threats, this is the department for fighting the nation's wars, i.e. the Bardeenian army. Its official mission statement only takes a defensive position, but it is also known to lead the one or other offensive, if necessary.
## Basic Training
Every adult citizen, who chooses to join the military, will be put through basic training first. Here the new recruit will learn all basic skills necessary to become a soldier. The training usually lasts a year and contains a bunch of maneuvers to evaluate how fit the recruit is for battle, and which specialization they seem to be best for.
1. After a month, new recruits are sent to camp out in the woods of the wild. There they have to survive as a unit against the usual dangers of the wild.
2. After half a year, the recruits are set against a team of acting soldiers. A real life war is simulated that way. Depending on each recruit's behavior, it is decided (by choice of the recruit as well as their trainers), if they are fit for battle or not.
3. In the end, all recruits are divided into two camps and set against each other in a simulated capture the flag scenario.

After successfully completing basic training, each soldier may choose a specialization or take the one recommended by their trainers. They will then be trained another year in their chosen **Force**.
## Forces
Bardeena's standing military is divided into these separate specialized **Forces**, which are organized individually but work together to fulfill their shared function.
### Troopers
The army's troops are made up of individual soldiers specialized in melee combat, armed or otherwise. They are trained to master their individual fighting style and weapons (swords, clubs, knives, fists, etc.) and most of them are even able to deflect single bullets this way.
### Rangers
Masters of firearms and ranged weapons of any kind (guns, rifles, even bows). They are trained to handle and maintain their chosen arms, as well as hitting any target with them as precisely as possible.
### Mystics
These soldiers develop into masterful [[Die Mystik|Mystics]] and fight with the full potential of their **animations**. 
All of them learn to master their own primary [[Die Elemente|Elemental]] form (the one most natural to them), as well as a secondary one (e.g. **2-Elements**).
### Motorists
Here soldiers either become engineers or drivers of the army's vehicle fleet (tanks, armored transporters, excavators, etc.)
### Sailors
The captains and crews of the Bardeenian marine.
### Aviators
The Bardeenian airforce has not developed further than a fleet of helicopters and a single larger airship anchored at [[Bavista]]. Still, new pilots and engineers are joining every year.
### The Elite
In order to become part of the elite, a soldier has to show multiple records of outstanding feats. An elite usually shows exceptional mastery in his chosen **Force**, or has mastered more than one of them.
## Ranks
Every soldier has one of the following ranks. These are universal for all **Forces** (yes, even the Marine) and dictate the chain of command when necessary. Each rank has 3 sub-ranks, denoted by stars.
- **Recruit** - Lowest rank for those still in basic training
- **Cadet** - The lowest rank in the standing army
- **Sergeant** - Taking on smaller responsibilities, like leading a single squad during missions
- **Lieutenant** - Responsible to organize and lead whole missions
- **Captain** - Responsible to come up with and evaluate multiple missions, [[Bardeena#Hierarchies|Head]] of a large unit like a dhip, an entire workshop or a magistrate of **Mystics**.
- **Major** - Responsible for the workings of an entire **Force**, e.g. Major Motorist, Major Aviator
- **General** - The general is the [[Bardeena#Hierarchies|Head]] of the entire department, there is only one
## Location & Occupation
Headquarters are situated in [[Bavista]] since the main threat to the country is currently the [[Die Forasier|forasian nation]], which mainly attacks from the east. Most **Forces** are stationed there as well, so seeing any soldier anywhere else is pretty rare.
A few squads of soldiers are stationed in and around [[The Institute of Science#Sections|Section I and II]], though, since the **Sections** contain a lot of knowledge vital to Bardeena's technological superiority. There are also a few expeditions done to explore still unknown parts of the continent, which are supported by military personal as well.
## Serving Time
Any recruit completing the first half of basic training, who decides to stay on, has to serve for at least 2 more years in a chosen **Force**. After those years, they may serve as long as they please. This way there is a good bit of turnover in the army. On the other hand, the country also creates a vast number of able-bodied citizens this way. A few soldiers even decide to come back to their **Force**, after they spent a few years away.
Additionally, each soldier has to swear the **Oath to Defend**, which places them under an obligation to take up arms again, in case the nation's security is threatened by an outside aggressor.
# Department of Police
Takes care to enforce peace and order inside the country's settlements. How this is realized depends fully on the respective settlement, though.
## Large Cities
Since [[Bavista]] is the main headquarters for the [[#Department of War]], [[Haarafir]] really is the only city that actually employs a larger police force. One precinct exists for each of the cities districts, while the **Chief of Police** is the department's [[Bardeena#Hierarchies|Head]] for the city.
The **Haarafir Police Department** (HDP), organizes its officers also into different ranks. However, here, the ranks aren't really hierarchical but rather subject oriented:
- **Officer** - The people on patrol, ready and available to help, if necessary
- **Detective** - People who investigate and attempt to solve actual cases
- **Specialist** - People trained for deeper, more specialized subjects (bombs, hazardeous materials, drugs, etc.)
- **Captain** - The precinct's **Head**, who prioritizes and assigns cases
The leaders of teams or cases are chosen on a per case basis, usually amongst volunteers from the respective ranks. The Captain has the last word, though, if they feel someone else should do it instead.
## Smaller Settlements
For small towns and villages it is usually enough to have a single **Sheriff** and maybe a handful of **Deputies**. Sheriff and Deputy aren't proper ranks in this case but rather titles given to those willing to take on the responsibilities. Suffice it to say, being police might not even be their main job.
## Involvement
It usually is every citizen's own responsibility to resolve conflicts amongst themselves. Therefore, the police are not concerned with upholding any kind of law and only interfere, if called upon by citizens. That means: In any conflict, at least one party has to actively ask the police to get involved.
Involving the police is a decision citizens don't take lightly. If the police get involved, they'll do their best to find a culprit, which then leads to heavy fines in addition to other punishment. In the worst case, the [[The National Office#Department of Law|Department of Law]] will get involved. Generally nobody wants that to happen, since court cases are very expensive. Whole lives can be destroyed by a single court case.  

So an officer is not obliged to step into other people's businesses. They may proactively offer to help, if they notice any commotion, though. However, they may also reluctantly step back again and let things run their course, if all conflicting parties agree, they don't want any police involved.
Still, there are a number of cases where they will step in, even when not asked to do so explicitly:
- As soon as a dispute escalates to physical violence    
- As soon as someone brandishes or shows off a weapon    
- As soon as someone starts [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Animation|animating]] in public    
- As soon as a [[The Ministry of Community#Levels of Maturity|Child or Teenager]] starts animating anywhere without adult supervision
At any of these points, the fighting parties are forfeiting their right to choose and the police step in. In the weapons or Animations cases they at least have to check, if the person in question holds a valid license, and withdraw again, if they do. If they don't, the police are obliged to take measures.
## Citizens in Arms
It is generally allowed for each citizen to carry any weapon of their choosing. There are even weapon shops all over the country selling to anyone willing to buy. However, buyers need to be adults with a valid weapon's license. They have to buy and complete a basic weapon's training first, where they earn their right to buy any weapon of their choosing.
The licenses for weapons are handle by the police, similar to how the [[The Ministry of Community#Department of Mysticism|Department of Mysticism]] hands out their **Animation Licenses**.
# Department of Warding
This department's mission is to defend Bardeena against the forces of nature themselves.
### The Ambulance
Stationed at strategic locations throughout every settlement, these will quickly jumpt to action, in case of a health emergency. They work pretty much the same way as ambulances from reality: Short reaction time, loud sirens, basic medical treatment, quick transport to the nearest [[The Ministry of Community#Department of Healthcare|clinic]].
### The Disaster Defenders
These are basically the Bardeenian firefighters. People are employed in shifts, some work on a voluntary basis, some as their main occupation. They stand ready to rush and help out with natural disasters of any size, e.g. house fires, floods, heavy weather, etc.
### The Guard
The guard's main task is to protect the citizens against the wilderness, namely the dangerous [[Die Anomi|Anomi]] living there. They are the ones building, maintaining, and manning the walls around each Bardeenian settlement.
That includes the operation of sometimes elaborate warning systems, that notify the population, in case anything powerful comes too close, e.g. a large [[Die Dämonen|demon]] or an entire horde of large [[Die Tiere|animals]].
Additionally, they are also the best guides to be found for expeditions beyond the city walls.

# Department of Commission
This department is the latest addition to the Defense Force and is still rather small and new. It consists of highly individual privately funded companies of varying sizes that can be hired for any kind of problem imaginable. Problems of the kind, which the other departments cannot or will not handle. Because problems might be
- too small for them to bother,
- too large for them to solve properly, or
- their involvement is simply not wanted.

While they are often also hired to do jobs that would belong to another department, they earn their keep by solving highly unusual, localized, individual, and even absurd problems like
- anomalous [[Die Mystik|mystic]] phenomena, e.g. cursed objects,
- commotions caused by [[Körperlose Seelen|disembodied souls]], e.g. [[Geister|ghosts]],
- small scale [[Die Anomi|anomi]] incidents, e.g. a giant rat infestation,
- help with moving someone's furniture,
- jump in for sick coworkers,
- pluck a daisy from the nearest lawn,
- in short anything a client asks for.

The first companies were founded in [[Haarafir]], some years after the military moved to [[Bavista]] by soldiers, who didn't want to move along. Despite having a rough few initial years, the most famous commission company became [[Ämber]], which was founded and headed by [[Lygea/Völker/Bardeena/Ämber/Jin Naidesh]].

	"The new homeland"  

Bardeena is a country formed by [[Kristallfeder Enjar]] and her group of adventurers, after they conquered large parts of the abandoned continent of [[Die Kontinente#Sciena|Sciena]]. Its society is mostly made up of multiple generations of [[Mischlinge#Invis-Mischlinge|Invis-Hybrids]] with rare pure blood families in between.

The word 'Bardeena' incorporates the 3 languages of the 3 cultures in **Kristallfeder**'s ancestry. It is a combination of '*Milubâr*' (neri. '*home*'), '*Dee*' (tey. '*land*'), and '*neu*' (*rowag.* '*new*'), which then means '*new homeland*'.
# History
After [[The Calamity]], Sciena was mostly covered by [[Sciena's earliest Conquerors|demonic corruption, Ghosts, or tough Anomi]] tribes. [[Kristallfeder Enjar]], and a band of outcasts like herself, [[The founding of Bardeena|conquered the continent as a safe home for themselves]], because they had nowhere else to go.
## A new State
After defeating most of the lingering threats, Kristallfeder and her allies officially founded the new independent state of Bardeena, spanning most of the north eastern part of Sciena. Though their settlements were fortified, they were still rather few in numbers and the wilderness in between was still dangerous for unwary travelers. There is now a bit of infrastructure outside the cities and outposts, but they are limited to single roads or underground railways. Often, citizens solemnly rely on travel by air with small planes or helicopters.
## Technological Development
The easy access to a multitude of [[Evelitische Geschichte#Die Dome|Evelitian Ruins]], often brimming to burst with left behind tech, helped Bardeena to establish itself as a valuable trade partner and a force to be reckoned with. It also boosted the technical and cultural development significantly. Before anyone knew it, Bardeena had become the most technically advanced country on the planet.

> [!note]
> Their society developed into something similar to that of middle and western Europe during the late 90's and early 2000s. So people inside the cities are used to technologies like cars, TVs, internet, and even the first smartphones. However, scientific breakthroughs are still made every day without widespread application, yet. One or the other fancy sci-fi gadget might also pop up here and there.
## Major Locations
Bardeena consists of a handful of cities and villages, mostly restored ruins left over by the **CALAMITY**. However it is mainly organized by the following few:
- [[Haarafir]] 
- [[Bavista]]
- [[Nasbel]]
- [[The Institute of Science|Section I & II]]
# Culture
Bardeena is a multicultural society, giving the individual a lot of freedom to believe or to celebrate whatever they want. That being said, there are a few common aspects to all of it.
## State & Society
State, or government for that matter, might not be a very accurate term in this case. Bardeenian society is loosely based on the basic ideas of [Social Anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anarchism), and therefore lacks something like a centralized government.
Individuality, self-responsibility, mutual cooperation, rhyme & reason morality, and direct Democracy are some of its core values. Everyone should be given equality in opportunity and security, but those wishing to go above and beyond are also encouraged to do so.
### Governmental Bodies
5 general organizational parts make up Bardeenian society. They each cooperate with as little hierarchy as possible, but with as much as needed while trying to equally share the country's resources:
- [[The National Office]]
- [[The Board of Requirements]]
- [[The Bardeena Defense Force]]
- [[The Institute of Science]]
- [[The Ministry of Community]]

Each part is further divided into different **departments**, which in turn unify a varying number of companies, projects or individuals under their banner. Those companies and projects vary in size and are usually owned and led by everyone with equal share.
### Hierarchies
Bardeenian society, though based on anarchism, is divided into an organizational hierarchy. However, this hierarchy is made up of people that are voted into these positions and have proven that they are suited for it. They are called **Heads** (...of Company X, … of Region Y, … of department Z).
**Heads** then usually are the main decision makers for their respective area of responsibility. They collect, consider, and communicate the wishes, needs and suggestions of their "subordinates" to other **Heads** in the same or higher positions. **Heads** of higher levels are voted into position by the **Heads** of lower levels, the lowest level **Heads** are chosen by their respective team. If everyone deems it necessary, a re-vote of **Head** can be triggered at any time. 

This way **Heads** of small teams, companies or departments communicate with each other on a need-to basis, which keeps decision making short. A meeting with the **Heads** of all **departments** is the highest form of governmental debate and usually occurs only for matters of national importance.
### Money
The simplest way to look at Bardeena's funds is to see it as a common budget that is shared by the entire nation. That budget is influenced by external trade, of course, and by what can be still salvaged from the land (including what the [[Die Eveliten|Evelitians]] left behind). How that budget is organized and distributed is handled by the [[The National Office#The Department of Resources|Department of Resources]] and the [[The Board of Requirements#The Department of Distribution|Department of Distribution]].
## The Law - The Rules of Reason
Bardeena does not have Laws in the classical sense. Simply put, their society works under the simple precept of "Do no harm, stand your ground" (colloq. be kind, but take no shit). This precept was put into place, by the nation's founders and developed over time into Bardeena's 10 Rules of Reason:
1. **Individuality** - Every individual has the right to follow their own path, choose yours, follow it through, and allow others to do the same.    
2. **Community** - Everyone brings something unique to the table. There is no justifiable reason to discriminate because of race, appearance, belief, philosophy, education, opinion or way of thinking.    
3. **Honesty** - Express yourself honestly and speak your truth in full. Do this to others and especially to yourself.    
4. **Gratitude** - Nobody can choose their circumstances of birth. Be humble and thankful to be here now.    
5. **Forgiveness** - Be proud of your mistakes, make them gladly, learn from them, and allow others to make theirs.    
6. **Generosity** - Give plentiful and help those in need, take readily and accept the help another is offering.    
7. **Self-Care** - Recognize and accept your wishes, desires, and needs, fulfill them with a good conscience, without apology, and see that others do so, too.    
8. **Balance** - Nobody can be strong all the time, allow yourself to be weak, and be strong for those that need you.    
9. **Protection** - Remember the battles necessary for anything around you. Be ready to protect it, but don't go looking for a fight.    
10. **Evolution** - Embrace change, grow, and readily share what you've learned.    
### Crime
All citizens and organizations are encouraged to settle disputes amongst themselves and for the most part this is done responsibly. That means that officially, there aren't any crimes in Bardeena. What is seen as a crime, and respective punishments, depends on the conflicting parties. This also includes harsh deeds like e.g. murder.

That being said, often the conflicting parties are unable to resolve their issues, or they escalate and become too big to handle. A party might be unable to represent their interests by themselves, too. In these cases, the [[The National Office#The Department of Law|Department of Law]], [[The Bardeena Defense Force#The Department of Police|Police]], and/or [[The Bardeena Defense Force#The Department of Commission|Commission]] might step in. Those disputes then are put before a rather classic trial with a Judge, Prosecution, Defense, and a verdict is reached everyone has to adhere to.
## Grievances
Due to Bardeena's universal income, free healthcare, and bonuses for special needs citizens, it is very uncommon to find anyone in a very bad situation. Unemployment is also considered a non-issue, since universal income covers it and society assumes everyone's goodwill, anyway. Refugees from other nations are generally welcome and integrated into society, too, if Bardeena can afford it.

However, life is not entirely without crime or those that wish to exploit the system for their own benefit. Bigger and smaller organizations have the opportunity to rise and cause misery and pain, if they manage to gain power in a certain area, like the district of a city.
Like any other issue, the nation's **departments** have to consider intervening carefully and balance it with their other tasks and their given budget. If a problem escalates too much, the **Department of Commission** is often mobilized to also deal with inner threats.
## Mysticism and the Elements
The ability to [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Animation|animate]] the [[Die Elemente|Elements]] is considered somewhat dangerous in Bardeena. Since the majority of citizens are [[Mischlinge|Hybrids]], [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Mystik|mystic]] skills come in a large variety and can be quite unpredictable. Society quickly agreed that some form of regulation is in order and the [[The Ministry of Community#The Department of Mysticism|Department of Mysticism]] was founded. Due to the department's rules and exams, it became harder for anyone to practice [[Die Mystik|mysticism]] openly. That and the comfortable modern living standards, have caused **mystic** abilities to develop into skills that most people don't bother to learn anymore.
Those that still do, mostly practice **mysticism** as some form of sport, as part of their jobs, or as other kind of intellectual pastime. The general population has mostly forgotten how to **animate**, though.
# Rituals
Many of Bardeena's citizens, especially former refugees, brought their religions, traditions, and rituals with them and found that they can practice them in peace here. This blending of cultures gave birth to some distinct rituals, but generally also caused the more traditional ways to dissolve.
## Soul Rituals
In Bardeena's modern society, nobody performs the [[Die Invis#Seelen-Rituale|rituals to soothe wandering souls]] knowingly anymore. However, traditional individuals that stick to their old ways as well as newer "rituals", like professional choirs or dancing schools, cannot help but accidentally soothe the one or other [[Die Seele|soul]] during their performances, without ever knowing what they did.
On the other hand, one or the other [[Geister|Ghost]] or [[Besessene|Possessed]] does appear, which then will be dealt with by specialists from the [[The Bardeena Defense Force|Bardeena Defense Force]].
## Birth & Childcare
Child delivery, in all its glorious hybrid variety, is handled by the midwives and hospitals of the departments of Family and Healthcare. It works much the same way as modern human society is used to. The training and schooling systems for children are further handled by the Ministry of Community and the Institute of Science.
## Death
Again, Bardeena's multicultural nature shows a multitude of individual rituals to say goodbye to the deceased. However, a burial ceremony not unlike the human christian ritual, is the most practiced amongst the people. This of course also caused the formation of graveyards as we know them.
## Leisure Time
In the spirit of balance, each citizen of Bardeena is granted the luxury of free time, which manifests in a number of national holidays, a set of recommended vacation days for working citizens, and a general 2 day weekend.
### National Holidays
- **30th of Teyember/1st of Lyruar**: New years eve - Two day celebration at the change of the year, basically the same as human new years.    
- **15th of Veril**: Day of Purification - Celebration in memory of the defeat of Mencarni and Anvita and the purification of the land for agriculture, similar to human Thanksgiving.    
- **3rd of Silember**: Founding day - Celebration in honor of the foundation of Bardeena.    
- **24th - 27th of Bolember**: Friendsharing - Christmas like celebration in remembrance of the friendship between Kristallfeder and her allies.    
- **4th of Forai**: Independence Day - Celebration in honor of fighting off the [[Die Forasier|Forasian]] threat at Bavista.    
- **30th of Nerivober**: Willaween - Celebration of driving out the spirits of Wilder, like Halloween
- **Last Lihday of Eveli**: Festival of Live - like human Eastern, inspired by [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] religion
(Check the [[Der lygeanische Kalender|lygean calendar]] for details about weekdays and months.)
### Vacations
- The recommended number of vacation days for each worker is 24 per year, but is by no means a rule. Some companies have a few less and some a few more.    
- Schools grant multiple weeks of vacation distributed over the year and usually grouped around the national holiday days.
### The Weekend
In general all departments do a 4 day work week, with 2 days in the week free. Those days are the last of the week, namely Firday, and Lihday.
### Essential Businesses
Endeavors and projects that require continuous operation, e.g. hospitals or power plants, will organize themselves into shifts and turns so everyone can enjoy their leisure time as well. Another common practice is to shift the weekend for a day or both in order to keep essential services running during essential times.

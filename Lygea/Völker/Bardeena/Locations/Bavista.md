The ancient city of Beía Vista, built by the Dragnarians during the Times of Fortification and abandoned due to THE_CALAMITY, was initially re-captured and fortified by Forasian Explorers.

During Bardeenas expansion the two nations came into contact. The Forasians, in their drive for conquest, didn't stop with the city and provoked a war with the growing nation.

When Kristallfeder and her friends entered themselves, the forasian forces were quickly driven out of the city and the continent.

From that point on Bardeena and Durandar were always at odds, with the occasional battle here and there. This war turned cold however, when Bardeena made an alliance with the Dragnarians, occupied the Islands of Ponta Cento, and established an effective sea-barrier between the two continents.

Main operations of military and government needed to be closer to their foreign relations then, and this is when Beía Vista took the title of capital from Haarafir.

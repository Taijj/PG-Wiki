# Physical
As the offspring of a [[Die Regidea|Regidea]] and an [[Die Invis#Die Ältesten|Eldest]], and additionally being conceived during a [[Kosmische Ereignisse|cosmic event]], Titania's and her [[#Family|sister]]'s existences are one of the most anomalous things possible in the lygean universe. Her appearance and abilities are definitely unique and result from this well timed birth.
## Common Appearance
Titania commonly appears as a tall well trained and tough female figure, showing elements of both her parents, as well as elements of her later offspring, the [[Die Titanier|Titanians]]. She grows hair like the [[Die Forasier|Forasians]], has **Titanian** ears and a wolven tail. Her hands and feet are rather humanoid with short claws, and she can grow impressive [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] antlers. She usually keeps those short, though.
Battle scars can be seen all over her body. The largest one sits on her lower belly and got worked into a [[Die Teyaner#Familientattoo|family-tatoo]] when she spent [[#Relationships & Friendships|time as a Teyan]].
## Shape shifting
Titania inherited some shapeshifting abilities form her [[#Family|father]], which she can use to alter her appearance. However, these are severely limited in comparison and require a lot of effort and discomfort from her side:
- She can change the colors of her eyes, hair, and skin according to her whim, but needs several hours of rest afterwards. She can also create any skin pattern or hair gradient that way.
- She can quickly grow her hair, claws, and antlers. She cannot grow them back, though.
- She can give herself a temporary muscle boost to become quicker and stronger. Doing that makes her grow an additional 3 centimeters, too.
- In last-resort situation, she might unleash her own [[#Anima-Form]].
Her age will always stay the same, she cannot change how old she looks. She also cannot hide the scars on her body.
# Personality
Titania is generally a disciplined, tough, and strict leader. She was raised in a masculine world, so she's rather out of touch with her feminine side, which she only came to embrace in her later years.
She led a ruthless live of breeding, war, and conquest before she had to leave it all behind. She learned the appreciation of life, compassion, and the intense love for [[Die Titanier|"her children"]], on her travels all over Lygea.
# Names
Titania is leading many different lives and she's meeting many people on her travels. Over the years she gathers many different names and titles:
- **Titania** - the name her [[#Family|father]] gave her, which means **Greatest of Flames**.
- **(Aunt) Nia** - the name she gave herself in modern times, after she discovered [[The Capsule Kids]].
- **Conqueror of Continents** - her time as her [[#Family|father's ]] right hand earned her this title all over Lygea
- // TODO
# Family
Her father is [[Foras]] whose plan was to create the [[Das Ultimative Volk|ultimate race]] at the beginning of the [[Timeline II|second Millennium]]. With the [[Die Geburt der Zwielichter|birth of her and her sister]] his plans finally succeeded after many years of trying.
Her mother is the [[Die Nerivaner#Generelle Regierungsstruktur|Nerivan High Inquisitress]], [[Candaera]]. She was seduced by a concealed **Foras** during the effects of [[Kosmische Ereignisse#Malomars Nähe - Malomars Aura|Malomar's Aura]], and she died shortly after her children were born.
While Titania's sister [[Seylúna]] was left behind and raised by [[Neriva]] herself, Titania was brought back to [[Die Kontinente#Durandar|Durandar]] to become the progenitor of Foras' ultimate race. On one hand, she was used to breed as many [[Die Titanier|Titanians]] as possible, with many men from different races. On the other hand, she was raised as the perfect warrior and lead **Foras**' armies into battle.
## Relationships & Friendships
After failing at the [[Titania's Story#The Invasion of Silviem|The invasion of Silviem]], her [[#Family|father]] banished her and she started traveling the world on her own. She concealed her true identity, got to know the other races and the devastation she had caused.
She lived many different lives during this time and became a member of each of the other [[Die Invis|Invis]] in the process. She was many things, sometimes for centuries, during this time: Warrior, politician, craftsman, artist, musician, lover, even wife, but never mother.
In the end she developed a longing for her own [[Die Titanier|Titanian]] "children" and she tried to help them redeem themselves and take a proper place amongst the races of Lygea.

Trinkets from the past:
- She joined the [[Die Teyaner|Teyan]] pilgrimage and fell in love with and married one of them. This is how she got the tattoo on her belly
- She became a [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] priestess and the Matron of an orphanage for a while. With the children in her care, she learned to play many instruments.

# Skills
Titania is a very powerful being. Her parents, her upbringing, her long life, and finally her travels gave her a vast skillset and unmatched powers. However, the defeat at the hands of [[Seylúna]] at the [[Titania's Story#The Invasion of Silviem|Invasion of Silviem]] left her permanently impaired. That fight not only gave her the largest of her body scars, but also inflicted irreparable wounds to her [[Die Seele|soul]].
These injuries permanently hinder the magic flow in her body and spirit, which causes cramps, blockages and bloody coughing fits, if she exerts herself too much. Before exhausting, she might still be able to take on a small army by herself, though. So she stays a force to be reckoned with.
## Combat
As the ultimate warrior, she was trained to fight with any kind of weapon, with her claws and even with her bare fists. What she had lacked as the [[#Names|Conqueror of Continents]], she refined and learned afterwards during her travels.

// TODO:
- a powerful weapon of her shame, she only uses, if necessary
- Research: Bloodbourne + Monsterhunter
- Crafted from primeordeal/Eldest Bones?
## Animations
Due to the [[#Family|circumstances of her birth]] Titania has a strong variety of [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Animation|animation abilities]].
### Elemental
The [[Die Elemente|elemental]] form coming most natural to her are dark flames, which contain strong traces of **Fire** and **Shadow** at the same time. But she's also able to animate the pure elements of **Fire** and **Shadow**, as well as the [[Die Elemente#Klassen|2-elements]] of **Nuclear** and **Negative**.
### Singular
Titania learned to manipulate a target's [[Die Singularitäten|Wisdom]]. She can implant false knowledge or even hide true memories of a person for some time. If the target is unconscious, her tinkering even lasts for decades.
### Soul
From her [[#Family|father]] she gained the limited ability to manipulate [[Die Seele|souls]]. She can feel a **soul**'s presence, check its state, and manipulate its parts in small increments. She can guide a [[Körperlose Seelen|disembodied soul]] shortly after death, and create [[Der Burst|Burst souls]] this way. Soul Animation is very hard work for her, though.
Coupled with her [[#Singular|singular]] abilities, she developed into an exceptionally high empath during her travels, too.
# Anima-Form
Another ability she got from her [[#Family|father]] is her own variant of an [[Die Regidea#Formwandlung|Anima-Form]]. However, it will only come out as a last resort. If she continues to [[#Shape shifting|buff-up]] past her thought capabilities, she will trigger it and transform.
She only [[Titania's Story|used it once]] without really knowing what she was doing, and she really doesn't know nor understands how she did it. Also: She almost exerted herself to death that time.

Eseyána is a [[Die Mystik#Basierend auf Mystik|mystical]] golden tree growing in the [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivan]] capital of **Milubâr**, on the continent of [[Die Kontinente#Silviem|Silviem]]. It is the fusion of [[Neriva]] and [[Lygrassyl]], which was formed due to [[Foras]]' retributory attack  after [[Titania's Story#The Invasion of Silviem|the Invasion of Silviem]].

# About
As its predecessor did, this tree surrounds the enclosing forest with a special kind of protective [[Die Seele#Die Aura|Aura]], full of life and light. Respectively the [[Die Silariel|Silariel]] took it upon themselves to continue their duties to tend to it, after the fusion.
Neriva and Lygrassyl are still guiding their people with visions, dreams, and the occasional miracle healing. The dual [[Die Seele|soul]] nature of their existence could be considered a form of [[Der Burst|Burst]], which helped them to protect themselves and their people even through [[The Calamity]].
In modern times, Eseyána still protects **Milubâr** and its surrounding forest and keeps its waters clean (especially the holy lake). However, it is completely cut off from the remains of Lygrassyl's roots, which became a rare resource for strong medicine or healing [[Die Mystik#Mystifizierungen|mystifications]].

Eseyána started out as a rather small sapling, roughly the size of a woman. Due to the dedicated care of her caretakers, over the centuries, she grew to the size of a large oak tree. She still continues to grow very slowly to this day.
# Name
After Neriva's sacrifice, when the [[Die Regidea|Regidea]] had gathered around the sapling, they named it in [[Voxciel]]. They gave it the name **Socrifica**, as a remembrance to their sister's sacrifice. The [[Die Nerivaner|Nerivans]] on the other hand, who had seen their great tree almost burn to the ground, saw a shimmer of hope in the little sapling, and named it accordingly. Eseyána then was the name it became known as, after the [[The Calamity#The End of the Regidea|Regidea's demise]].
